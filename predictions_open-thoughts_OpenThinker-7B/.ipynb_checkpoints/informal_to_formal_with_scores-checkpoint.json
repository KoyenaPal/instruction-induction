    "instruction_outputs": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nI gave a friend an instruction and five inputs. The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs.\nHere are the input-output pairs:\n\nInput: Please call once you get there.\nOutput: Please call upon your arrival.\n\nInput: Thanks for your help.\nOutput: Your assistance is much appreciated.\n\nInput: This song is fire.\nOutput: This song is incredibly good.\n\nInput: See you tonight.\nOutput: I look forward to meeting you tonight.\n\nInput: I got what you said.\nOutput: I understood you.\n\nThe instruction was<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<|begin_of_thought|>Okay, let's try to figure out what the original instruction was that the friend used to transform those inputs into outputs. Hmm. Let's start by looking at each input-output pair to see if there's a pattern or common transformation applied.\n\nFirst pair: Input \"Please call once you get there.\" Output \"Please call upon your arrival.\" So here, the friend replaced \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\". The structure changed slightly, but the meaning is similar.\n\nSecond input-output: \"Thanks for your help.\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Oh, here they turned it into a more formal or polished response. So maybe converting gratitude into a more elaborate expression of appreciation.\n\nThird input: \"This song is fire.\" Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\" Here, the friend took the informal slang term \"fire\" (which means great, excellent) and translated it into a more standard adjective \"incredibly good\". So replacing slang with more formal words.\n\nFourth input: \"See you tonight.\" Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" So instead of a casual plan, the response became a more formal statement expressing anticipation.\n\nFifth input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" So here, they simplified the phrasing. Instead of saying they got the message, they said they understood the person directly.\n\nNow, looking for a common thread. All these outputs seem to be more formal or polite versions of the inputs. For example, the first output uses \"upon your arrival\" which is a more formal way than \"once you get there\". Similarly, the second one converts thanks into a longer sentence, third replaces slang, fourth makes a casual plan into a formal expression of looking forward, fifth simplifies \"I got what you said\" to \"I understood you\".\n\nSo maybe the instruction was something like: \"Polish the response by making it more formal, replacing informal phrases with more polite or standard language.\" Alternatively, perhaps it's about converting informal expressions into more professional or traditional language.\n\nAlternatively, could it be about rephrasing in a more formal tone? Let's check the examples again. Each output is more formal than the input. First input is a request, output is a bit more formal. Second input is a thank you, output is more elaborated. Third slang to more descriptive. Fourth casual plan to formal anticipation. Fifth simplification but still formal.\n\nWait, in the fifth case, the input is \"I got what you said.\" Output is \"I understood you.\" So actually, it's more concise and maybe slightly more formal. \"Got what you said\" is a bit colloquial, whereas \"understood you\" might be more direct. So perhaps the instruction is to take informal expressions and turn them into more formal, perhaps even more polite or professional language.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to \"rephrase the sentence in a more formal tone, using appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures.\" That would fit all the examples.\n\nLooking back at each example:\n\n1. From \"call once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival\". The original is slightly informal (using \"once\"), the output uses a preposition phrase (\"upon your arrival\"). So replacing \"once you get there\" with a more formal alternative.\n\n2. \"Thanks for your help\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" So expanding the short phrase into a more detailed compliment.\n\n3. \"This song is fire\" → \"incredibly good.\" Slang replaced with more standard adjectives.\n\n4. \"See you tonight\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" Casual plan to a more formal expression of anticipation.\n\n5. \"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\" Simplifying while maintaining formality.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to take each input and convert it into a more formal or polite version. Maybe even more elaborate. For example, turning a simple \"Yes\" into \"Certainly, I confirm...\" or something, but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction was to \"Polish the response into a more formal tone, using appropriate grammar and vocabulary.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about making the response more indirect or euphemistic. For example, replacing \"call now\" with \"call as soon as possible,\" but that doesn't fit the given examples.\n\nWait, let's check the first example again. Original input: \"Please call once you get there.\" The output is \"Please call upon your arrival.\" So the structure changed from \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival\". So perhaps the instruction was to replace certain phrases with more formal alternatives. But why only those specific phrases?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal version using synonyms or rephrasing tools. For instance, using more elevated language.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, all seem to involve increasing formality. So the instruction could be: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal version, ensuring proper grammar and using appropriate vocabulary.\"\n\nBut let's see if there's another possible instruction. For example, maybe the instruction was to make the response more positive or encouraging. Like, turning \"I understand\" into \"I look forward to it.\" But the fifth example doesn't fit that. Wait, fifth example's input is \"I got what you said\" and output is \"I understood you.\" So it's similar, but the output is more direct. So maybe not about positivity, but formality.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to replace idiomatic expressions with their literal meanings. For example, \"upon your arrival\" is the literal translation of \"once you arrive,\" but in this case, the input didn't have any idiomatic expressions. The original input was just a simple sentence.\n\nHmm. Another thought: perhaps the instruction was to use a thesaurus-like approach, replacing certain words with synonyms to make the output more sophisticated. For example, replacing \"understand\" with \"appreciate,\" but that's more context-dependent.\n\nWait, looking at the third example: \"This song is fire\" → \"incredibly good.\" Fire here is slang meaning excellent, so replacing with a synonym. So maybe the instruction was to replace informal terms with more formal equivalents.\n\nBut how does that apply to other examples? Let's see:\n\nSecond example: \"Thanks for your help\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Here, the original is already a formal expression of thanks. The output is more elaborate, but still formal. So maybe it's about elaborating on the sentiment rather than changing formality level. But the first example is a simple request turned into a slightly more formal phrase.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to turn the input into a more formal response, perhaps using titles or formal address. But the examples don't show that. For example, the first output is \"Please call upon your arrival.\" No formal address added.\n\nWait, let's think differently. What if the instruction was to \"convert the input into a more formal, professional reply, often expanding or rephrasing the original message.\" That seems plausible. All the outputs are indeed more formal than the inputs. For example:\n\n- \"Once you get there\" → \"Upon your arrival\"\n- \"Thanks\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated\"\n- \"Fire\" → \"Incredibly good\"\n- \"See you tonight\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight\"\n- \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\"\n\nSo each output is more formal and possibly longer. Therefore, the instruction likely was something like \"Polish each input into a more formal and polite response, enhancing clarity and formality.\"\n\nBut let me verify again. For the first example, \"Please call once you get there\" → \"Please call upon your arrival.\" The original is okay, but perhaps the instruction wanted to use a more formal preposition phrase. So replacing \"once\" with \"upon your arrival.\" But why would that be the instruction? Maybe the friend was told to replace certain phrases with more formal alternatives. However, without seeing the actual instruction, we can only hypothesize based on the examples.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the instruction involved using specific transformation rules. For example, replacing \"call once you get there\" with \"call when you arrive.\" But that's not what happened. The output uses \"upon your arrival\" which is a different structure. So perhaps the instruction was to rewrite the sentence using a particular structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal register, which would involve various changes like substituting \"call once you get there\" with \"call upon your arrival,\" changing \"thanks\" to \"appreciated,\" slang to more descriptive adjectives, casual plans to formal anticipation, and simplifying \"I got what you said\" to \"I understood you.\"\n\nPutting this all together, the most plausible instruction would be to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, and perhaps slightly more elaborate response, using appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures. This fits all the examples provided.\n\nSo the instruction was likely: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal and polite response, ensuring proper grammar and using appropriate vocabulary to enhance clarity and formality.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to the friend was likely:  \n**\"Polish each input into a more formal and polite response, enhancing clarity and formality through appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures.\"**\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Formalization of Phrases**: \n   - \"Once you get there\" → \"Upon your arrival\" (replacing colloquial phrasing with a formal prepositional phrase).  \n2. **Elaboration of Gratitude**:  \n   - \"Thanks for your help\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" (expanding a short phrase into a more elaborate expression of thanks).  \n3. **Replacement of Slang**:  \n   - \"This song is fire\" → \"This song is incredibly good\" (substituting informal slang with more descriptive adjectives).  \n4. **Casual to Formal Anticipation**:  \n   - \"See you tonight\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight\" (transforming a casual plan into a formal statement of expectation).  \n5. **Simplification While Maintaining Politeness**:  \n   - \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\" (rephrasing concisely while retaining politeness).  \n\nEach output exemplifies adherence to a rule of enhancing formality, grammatical correctness, and clarity through strategic vocabulary choices and sentence restructuring.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs where their friend transformed each input into an output according to some hidden instruction. My job is to figure out what that original instruction was. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the pattern between each input and output. Let's list them again:\n\n1. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n2. Input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n3. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n4. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n5. Input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\"\n\nLooking at these, maybe there's a common transformation or rephrasing method. Let's take each pair step by step.\n\nStarting with the first example: Input is a statement in first person present tense (\"considered\"), output is a more neutral or formal version (\"Various approaches were considered\"). Wait, but the output is still in past tense? Maybe the instruction involves changing the perspective from first to third person? Let's check other outputs.\n\nSecond input: Original is a question (\"Can you...\"), output is a conditional question (\"Would you...\"). So here, the structure changes from a simple \"can\" to \"would you be able to\". That might be part of a style shift—perhaps making the request more polite or formal.\n\nThird input: Original is a direct expression of the speaker's thought (\"I think...\"), output shifts to a slightly more indirect phrasing (\"It is my opinion...\"). So here, replacing \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion that...\" could be part of the instruction.\n\nFourth input: Question \"Do you want me to...\" becomes \"Shall I...\" which is another way to phrase an offer. \"Shall\" is often used as a softer alternative to \"do you want me to\".\n\nFifth input: \"I got what you said.\" becomes \"I understood you.\" So here, the subject is changed from first person to second person, and the verb is rephrased from \"got\" to \"understood\".\n\nHmm. So putting these together, possible instructions could involve various transformations like:\n\n- Changing the perspective from first to third person (e.g., replacing \"I\" with \"It is my opinion\").\n- Rephrasing questions into more polite or formal alternatives (like replacing \"can you\" with \"would you be able to\", or changing \"do you want\" to \"shall I\").\n- Converting affirmative statements into slightly more objective or formal phrasing (like \"considered\" to \"were considered\", or \"got what you said\" to \"understood you\").\n- Modifying verb tenses (but not sure yet).\n\nWait, looking at the first output: \"Various approaches were considered.\" The original is \"I considered...\", so maybe changing the perspective from first person singular to third person plural? But that doesn't seem consistent across all outputs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to make the input more formal or objective. For instance:\n\n1. Change \"I\" to \"It is my opinion\" when expressing thoughts.\n2. Replace \"can you\" with \"would you be able to\" to soften the question.\n3. Replace \"Do you want me...\" with \"Shall I...\" as a polite offer.\n4. Convert \"I understood you\" from first to second person: \"you\" becomes \"you understood\"? Wait, no. The fifth input is \"I got what you said\" → output \"I understood you.\" So here, first person \"I\" becomes second person \"you\" in the output. Wait, but the input was \"I got...\" and output is \"I understood...\", so maybe changing the subject's perspective. Let me check each input-output pair:\n\nInput 1: First person (\"I considered\") → output still first person but more formal (\"Various approaches were considered\"). Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, input 1's output is third person: \"Various approaches were considered.\" So changing \"I\" to third person. Input 3's output is also third person. Inputs 4's output is third person: \"Shall I accompany you?\" (though \"you\" is still present). Wait, maybe not. The fourth input is \"Do you want me to...\" → output \"Shall I accompany you?\" So here, \"Do you want me to...\" is transformed into \"Shall I...\" which is a different construction but still uses \"I\". So maybe changing the modal verb. For example, \"can\" becomes \"be able to\", \"want me to\" becomes \"accompany you\".\n\nAnother approach: looking for regularity across all outputs. Let's see:\n\n1. Input: I considered → Output: Various approaches were considered. The original is first person, present perfect. Output is third person, past tense. So maybe replacing \"I\" with \"various\" and changing the sentence structure. Or maybe it's rephrasing the entire sentence into a passive voice? Not sure.\n\n2. Input: Can you... → Output: Would you be able to... So here, the modal \"can\" is replaced with \"would you be able to\". This could be part of making the question less direct and more polite.\n\n3. Input: I think... → Output: It is my opinion that... So changing the perspective from first to third person, and using \"my opinion\" to frame the statement.\n\n4. Input: Do you want me to... → Output: Shall I... So replacing \"Do you want\" with \"Shall I\", which is a different phrasing for offering help.\n\n5. Input: I got what you said. → Output: I understood you. Changing \"I\" to \"I\" (same person), but \"got what you said\" to \"understood you\". So maybe rephrasing \"got\" as \"understood\", and changing the object pronoun from \"what you said\" to \"you\".\n\nPutting all these together, perhaps the instruction involves transforming each input into a more formal or indirect equivalent. Let's hypothesize possible rules:\n\n1. If the input is a first-person statement expressing personal opinion, replace it with \"It is my opinion that...\".\n2. If the input is a direct question using \"can you\", rephrase it as \"Would you be able to...\".\n3. If the input is a question starting with \"do you want\", rephrase it as \"Shall I...\".\n4. If the input is \"I understood you\", output the same. But input 5's output is similar but different phrasing. Wait, input 5 is \"I got what you said\" → output \"I understood you.\" So here, \"got\" is replaced with \"understood\", and \"what you said\" becomes \"you\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to turn first-person statements into third-person observations. For example:\n\n- Replace \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion that...\".\n- Replace \"I considered\" with \"Various approaches were considered\" (changing \"I\" to \"various\" and the structure).\n- \"I understood you\" becomes \"I understood you\" (similar but perhaps a slight variation).\n\nBut that doesn't cover all cases. Let's see if there's a common thread.\n\nAnother angle: The outputs often use \"would\", \"shall\", \"is my opinion\", which are more formal or polite. Maybe the instruction is to make the language more polite or indirect.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis against the examples:\n\n1. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\" So replacing \"I\" with \"various\" and changing the structure to a passive voice. This might be a way to remove personal bias or make it more objective.\n\n2. Input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" Replacing \"can you\" with \"would you be able to\" — more polite and using \"be able to\" instead of the simple \"can\".\n\n3. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" Changing \"I think\" to a third-person phrasing, and adding \"my opinion\".\n\n4. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\" Changing \"Do you want me to...\" to \"Shall I...\" — a softer way to ask for assistance.\n\n5. Input: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\" Replacing \"got\" with \"understood\" and changing the object pronoun from \"what you said\" to \"you\".\n\nSo, combining all these, the instruction seems to involve:\n\n- Rephrasing first-person statements into third-person or more formal equivalents (e.g., replacing \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion\").\n- Polishing questions by making them more polite or indirect (e.g., changing \"can you\" to \"would you be able to\").\n- Transforming direct requests into more polite offers (\"Do you want me to...\" → \"Shall I...\").\n- Replacing \"got\" with \"understood\" and adjusting the pronoun.\n\nAlternatively, another possible instruction could be to convert all first-person inputs into third-person, but that doesn't fit all examples. For example, input 1 becomes third person, but input 3 does too. However, input 5's \"I got...\" becomes \"I understood...\", which is a different substitution.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to notice that the outputs often start with a phrase that frames the speaker's role or perspective. For example:\n\n- \"Various approaches were considered\" implies that someone else considered them, not the speaker.\n- \"Would you be able to...\" is a polite form of asking.\n- \"It is my opinion...\" places the statement in a third-person perspective.\n- \"Shall I...\" is an offer.\n- \"I understood you\" keeps the first-person but replaces \"got\" with \"understood\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to turn first-person expressions into third-person or more detached versions. For instance:\n\n- Replace \"I think\" with \"One might argue that\" but that doesn't match the given outputs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert all first-person inputs into third-person or replace \"I\" with \"one\", but the given outputs don't show that.\n\nWait, looking back at the outputs:\n\nInput 1 Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\" — third person, passive voice.\nInput 3 Output: \"It is my opinion that...\" — third person.\nInput 5 Output: \"I understood you.\" — same person, but different phrasing.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the rule is:\n\nFor any input, if it's a first-person statement, rewrite it in a more formal or detached manner, possibly changing \"I\" to \"various\" or \"one\", and altering the sentence structure.\n\nBut input 5 is \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you.\" Here, \"got\" is replaced with \"understood\", which might mean converting past participle verbs into more direct synonyms. So maybe replacing \"got\" with \"understood\" and adjusting the pronoun from \"you\" to \"you\".\n\nWait, the input is \"I got what you said.\" Output is \"I understood you.\" So \"got\" becomes \"understood\", and \"what you said\" becomes \"you\". But why the change in the object? Because \"got what you said\" is a bit colloquial, so the output makes it more direct by removing \"what\" and just stating that they understood you.\n\nSimilarly, input 1: \"I considered...\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" Here, \"considered\" becomes \"were considered\" — maybe changing the perspective from first person to third, and restructuring as a passive voice?\n\nBut \"I considered\" is first person active, output is third person passive. So maybe the instruction is to make the subject third person and use passive voice. But that would require a different process for each input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or indirect equivalent, sometimes using different grammar structures.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for common transformations in each category:\n\n1. Statements about oneself:\n   - Input: \"I considered...\"\n   - Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n   - Possible transformation: Remove \"I\", rephrase as passive voice, add \"various\".\n\n2. Questions expressing ability:\n   - Input: \"Can you...\"\n   - Output: \"Would you be able to...\"\n   - Transformation: Use \"be able to\" instead of \"can\", more polite phrasing.\n\n3. Direct requests:\n   - Input: \"Do you want me to...\"\n   - Output: \"Shall I...\"\n   - Transformation: Change from \"do you want\" to \"shall I\", softer request.\n\n4. First-person opinions:\n   - Input: \"I think...\"\n   - Output: \"It is my opinion that...\"\n   - Transformation: Remove \"I\", use third-person, introduce \"my opinion\".\n\n5. Affirmative understanding:\n   - Input: \"I got what you said.\"\n   - Output: \"I understood you.\"\n   - Transformation: Replace \"got\" with \"understood\", adjust the object pronoun from \"what you said\" to \"you\".\n\nSo compiling all these transformations, the instruction could be something like:\n\n\"For any input, if it starts with 'I' followed by a verb, rephrase it into a more formal or indirect equivalent. Specifically:\n\n- When the input is a first-person statement expressing an action, rephrase it into a third-person passive voice with a more objective description (e.g., \"I considered\" → \"Various approaches were considered\").\n\n- When the input is a question using 'can you', rephrase it to 'Would you be able to...', using a more polite and capable tone.\n\n- When the input is a question asking for permission or help ('do you want me to...'), rephrase it to 'Shall I...', maintaining a polite offer.\n\n- When the input is a direct expression of the speaker's opinion ('I think that...'), rephrase it to 'It is my opinion that...' to frame it as an observation rather than a personal belief.\n\n- When the input is an affirmative understanding expressed as 'I got what you said.', rephrase it to 'I understood you.' using a more direct synonym for 'got' and adjusting the object pronoun from 'what you said' to 'you' for clarity.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler instruction. For instance, if the input starts with \"I\", change it to a third-person perspective, and adjust the sentence accordingly. But that doesn't explain the variations in other categories.\n\nWait, but looking at the first example, the output is in third person but doesn't exactly use \"he\" or \"she\", just \"various approaches\". Maybe the instruction is to generalize \"I\" into \"various\" or \"many\" approaches when it's a statement. Similarly, \"Do you want me...\" becomes \"Shall I...\", which is a different structure but still retains \"I\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert all first-person statements into third-person observations by changing \"I\" to \"It is my opinion that...\" for opinions, and using passive voice for actions. For example, \"I considered\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered\" (passive) and \"I think...\" becomes \"It is my opinion...\".\n\nIn the case of the understanding, \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\" is a straightforward synonym substitution. For questions like \"Can you...\", the transformation adds \"be able to\" and changes the modal from \"can\" to \"would\".\n\nAnother possibility: The instruction could be to make the input more polite or formal by using certain phrasing conventions. For example:\n\n- Replace \"Can you\" with \"Would you be able to\" to be more polite.\n- Replace \"Do you want me to...\" with \"Shall I...\" to make it a more direct offer.\n- Use \"It is my opinion that...\" for statements of personal belief.\n- Use passive voice or third-person for actions.\n- Replace \"got\" with \"understood\" and adjust the object pronoun.\n\nThis seems to cover all the examples. So putting this all together, the instruction likely involves multiple steps depending on the type of input:\n\n1. For statements starting with \"I\":\n   - If it expresses a personal opinion, rephrase as \"It is my opinion that...\".\n   - If it's an action statement, rephrase into passive voice with third person (e.g., \"I considered\" → \"Various approaches were considered\").\n   \n2. For questions:\n   - Replace \"Can you...\" with \"Would you be able to...\".\n   - Replace \"Do you want me to...\" with \"Shall I...\".\n\n3. For affirmative understandings (\"I got...\"):\n   - Replace \"got\" with \"understood\" and adjust the object pronoun from \"what you said\" to \"you\".\n\nThus, the original instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite equivalent, adjusting the grammatical structure and phrasing as needed. The specific transformations would depend on the type of input, leading to the various outputs provided.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction required transforming each input into a more formal, polite, or indirect equivalent through specific rephrasing patterns. Here's the systematic breakdown:\n\n1. **Personal Opinion Statements**:  \n   - Replace \"I think...\" with \"It is my opinion that...\" to distance the speaker’s bias.  \n   - Example Input: *\"I think that this is interesting.\"*  \n     Output: *\"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"*\n\n2. **Direct Questions About Ability**:  \n   - Replace \"Can you...\" with \"Would you be able to...\" to soften the request and use \"be able to\" for capability.  \n   - Example Input: *\"Can you do all these tasks?\"*  \n     Output: *\"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"*\n\n3. **Requests for Action/Assistance**:  \n   - Replace \"Do you want me to...\" with \"Shall I...\" to reframe the offer as a polite suggestion.  \n   - Example Input: *\"Do you want me to go with you?\"*  \n     Output: *\"Shall I accompany you?\"*\n\n4. **Passive Voice and Third-Person Observations**:  \n   - Convert first-person actions to third-person passive voice.  \n   - Example Input: *\"I considered many approaches.\"*  \n     Output: *\"Various approaches were considered.\"*\n\n5. **Affirmative Understanding**:  \n   - Substitute \"got\" with \"understood\" and clarify the pronoun (\"you\") instead of \"what you said.\"  \n   - Example Input: *\"I got what you said.\"*  \n     Output: *\"I understood you.\"*\n\n**Final Instruction**:  \n\"Rephrase each input into a more formal or polite equivalent by adhering to the following transformations:  \n- Personal opinions → 'It is my opinion that...'.  \n- Requests for ability → 'Would you be able to...'.  \n- Offers of help → 'Shall I...'.  \n- Actions → Passive third-person.  \n- Affirmative understanding → 'I understood you.'\"  \n\nThis instruction ensures inputs are communicated in a courteous and structured manner.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

    "instruction_outputs": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nI gave a friend an instruction and five inputs. The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs.\nHere are the input-output pairs:\n\nInput: This song is fire.\nOutput: This song is incredibly good.\n\nInput: I can't stand his temper.\nOutput: I cannot tolerate his temper.\n\nInput: I considered many approaches.\nOutput: Various approaches were considered.\n\nInput: I got what you said.\nOutput: I understood you.\n\nInput: The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful. \nOutput: The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\n\nThe instruction was<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<|begin_of_thought|> Okay, let's try to figure out the instruction that the friend used to generate those outputs from the inputs. Hmm, the user provided five input-output pairs, so I need to find a pattern or rule that connects each input to its output. Let me go through each pair one by one.\n\nStarting with the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\nSo here, the original statement is very short and uses informal slang (\"fire\"). The output is more formal and expands \"fire\" into \"incredibly good.\" Maybe the instruction is to translate colloquial phrases into more standard phrasing? But wait, maybe it's about rephrasing in general. Let me check other examples.\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\nThe input has \"can't stand,\" which is a common expression meaning they dislike something. The output uses \"cannot tolerate,\" which is a more formal version of the same idea. So perhaps the instruction is to replace idiomatic expressions with their more formal equivalents?\n\nThird example:\nInput: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\nOriginal sentence uses \"considered\" as the passive voice. The output makes it active by using \"were considered\" but changes \"many\" to \"various.\" Wait, the input is active voice (\"I considered\"), and the output is passive. So maybe the instruction is to convert active sentences to passive, but sometimes changing some words. Wait, in this case, the input is already active. Hmm. Maybe another aspect. Alternatively, maybe it's about adjusting word choice. Let's see other outputs.\n\nFourth pair:\nInput: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\"\nOriginal is informal, like a quick confirmation. Output is more direct and formal. So maybe replacing informal expressions with more precise or formal ones. Like turning slang into standard English.\n\nFifth example:\nInput: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nHere, the input uses the object relative pronoun \"I met,\" and the output uses \"whom I met.\" So replacing \"I met\" (using the subject pronoun \"I\") with \"whom,\" which is the objective case. So the instruction might be to replace certain pronouns with their objective forms, possibly in relative clauses.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction seems to involve several possible transformations. Let's see:\n\n1. Replace colloquialisms with more formal phrasing (e.g., \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\", \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\").\n2. Convert active voice to passive (but wait, the third input was active, and the output made it passive? Wait no, the third input was \"I considered many approaches\" (active), output was \"Various approaches were considered\" (passive). So yes, converting to passive voice. But wait, the second input was \"I can't stand...\" (passive?), but the output is still passive. So maybe the general instruction is to convert active to passive? Or maybe not all examples fit.\n\nWait, the second input was \"I can't stand...\" which is a passive construction? No, \"can't stand\" is an active verb phrase. The subject is \"I\" performing the action. Wait, actually, \"can't stand\" is often used to mean \"cannot endure\" something, so the object is the thing being stood, but grammatically, it's active. So the output \"cannot tolerate\" is also active. So maybe that example isn't about passive voice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to replace certain verbs or phrases with synonyms. For example, \"considered\" in the third example becomes \"various\" + \"were considered,\" but that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence by replacing specific words or phrases with their antonyms or opposites? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: \"fire\" becomes \"incredibly good\" — not really an antonym. \"Can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate\" — same meaning but more formal. \"I considered\" → \"various approaches were considered\" — not sure. \"Got what you said\" → \"understood you\" — similar idea, more direct. \"Met yesterday\" → \"whom I met\" — changing \"met\" to \"whom,\" perhaps in a relative clause.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the instruction is to convert first-person singular present tense to third-person plural? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: \"is\" → \"is\" (third person). Output: \"is\" (same). So no. Third input: \"I considered\" → \"were considered\" (third person). But output is \"various approaches were considered.\" Hmm.\n\nWait, the fifth input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met.\" So replacing \"met\" (past tense) with \"whom I met.\" So that's a pronoun change. Also, \"I\" is changed to \"whom\" in the relative clause.\n\nLooking at that, perhaps the instruction involves changing possessive pronouns in relative clauses to objective case. Like, in the input, when there's a relative clause introduced by \"who\" or \"that,\" and the clause has a pronoun subject, replacing that pronoun with the objective case. For example, in \"I met the man who I saw,\" you would change \"who I saw\" to \"whom I saw.\"\n\nBut the fifth example's input was \"I met yesterday\" (no \"who\"), but in the output, it's \"whom I met.\" Wait, maybe in relative clauses where the relative pronoun is omitted, inserting \"whom.\" Wait, in the input, the relative clause is \"I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output adds \"whom,\" making it \"whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So maybe the instruction is to insert \"whom\" before the relative clause when it refers to the subject. But that might not fit all cases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about changing reflexive pronouns or possessives to objective. But I'm not seeing that elsewhere.\n\nLet's look again at the first example: \"This song is fire.\" Output is \"This song is incredibly good.\" So replacing a slang term with an adjective. Similarly, \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate,\" which is more formal. \"Considered many approaches\" → \"various approaches were considered.\" Here, \"many\" becomes \"various,\" and the structure is changed to passive. \"Got what you said\" → \"understood you,\" more direct. \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met.\"\n\nHmm. So possible transformations:\n\n1. Replace informal/colloquial language with more formal or standard phrasing.\n2. Passive voice conversion.\n3. Changing possessive pronouns to objective case in relative clauses.\n4. Replacing certain adjectives/adverbs (like \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\").\n5. Converting reported speech or statements to direct/indirect vs. direct?\n\nWait, \"got what you said\" → \"understood you.\" That seems like changing the perspective. Instead of saying \"I got [the message]\" (receiving information), it's \"I understood [you].\" So maybe changing from first-person reception to direct comprehension.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert the entire sentence into the passive voice, but that doesn't fit all examples. For instance, the second input is \"I can't stand his temper.\" Passive would be \"His temper is something I can't stand,\" which doesn't match the output. So maybe not.\n\nAnother approach: looking for parts of speech changes. For example, \"fire\" (noun) becomes \"incredibly good\" (adjective phrase). \"Considered\" (past tense verb) becomes \"various approaches were considered\" (passive voice with different subject). \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\" (changing pronoun to object case).\n\nWait, let's think about the last example again: Input \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the only change is \"I met\" → \"whom I met.\" So replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met.\" So the instruction might be to replace \"met\" with \"whom I met\" whenever it appears. But why \"I met\" specifically?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in cases where the relative clause uses \"who\" or \"that,\" the referent is the subject of the main clause, so we use \"whom.\" Wait, in the input, the relative clause is introduced by \"I met,\" but there's no \"who\" or \"that.\" The output adds \"whom,\" implying that the relative clause should have a \"whom.\" Maybe the instruction is to insert \"whom\" before the relative clause when the clause refers back to the subject. For example, if the input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday helped,\" then the output would be \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday helped.\" But why does the output add \"whom I met\" instead of just keeping \"I met\"?\n\nWait, maybe the original input's relative clause is missing the relative pronoun, and the instruction is to add \"whom.\" Let me check the original input:\n\nInput: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the structure is Subject (lawyer) + past participle (met) + relative clause (yesterday was helpful). The output adds \"whom\" to the beginning of the relative clause: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the relative clause is now introduced by \"whom,\" and the rest follows. So the instruction could be to make the relative clause use \"whom\" as the relative pronoun, hence adding \"whom\" before \"I met yesterday.\"\n\nIf that's the case, then the instruction is to convert any relative clause in the input (introduced by \"I met\") to use \"whom\" instead of the implied subject. But why only when \"I met\" is present? Because the input examples show that. So perhaps the instruction is to replace the phrase \"I met\" with \"whom I met\" when it introduces a relative clause.\n\nBut let's see if this applies to other examples. For instance, if there was an input like \"The book I read yesterday was interesting,\" the output would be \"The book whom I read yesterday was interesting\"? That doesn't make sense. So maybe the instruction is only applicable when \"I met\" is part of the input. Alternatively, maybe it's about replacing the subject pronoun with the object form when it's the subject of the relative clause.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to replace \"I met\" with \"whom I met\" in cases where it introduces a relative clause that refers to the subject. For example, in the input \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful,\" the relative clause \"I met yesterday\" refers back to the lawyer. So replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met\" because \"lawyer\" is the subject of the relative clause, and \"whom\" is the objective case pronoun for the subject. But that's a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to insert \"whom\" before any past participle that follows \"I met,\" thereby changing the sentence structure. But that seems arbitrary. Let's see another example. If there was an input like \"He saw the movie he watched last night,\" the output would be \"He saw the movie whom he watched last night.\" But that's changing \"he watched\" to \"whom he watched,\" which might not be correct. Because \"watched\" is the past tense, and \"he\" is the subject. But in the output, \"whom\" would be the object. So perhaps that's a different scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to convert \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" only when it's a relative clause referring to the subject. For example, in \"The person I saw yesterday is gone,\" the output would be \"The person whom I saw yesterday is gone.\" That makes sense because \"saw\" is the verb, and the subject is \"person,\" so \"whom\" would be appropriate.\n\nIn the given example, the input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, \"I met\" is followed by \"yesterday was helpful.\" The subject of the main clause is \"lawyer,\" so the relative clause refers back to the lawyer. Therefore, changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" to use the objective case pronoun \"whom\" for the subject of the relative clause.\n\nSo this could be part of the instruction. Now, considering other examples:\n\nFirst example: \"This song is fire.\" Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\" This might be replacing slang with a more elaborate descriptor. Not sure if it fits the \"I met\" pattern.\n\nSecond example: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Here, \"can't stand\" is replaced with \"cannot tolerate,\" which is a synonym. This could be part of the general transformation of replacing informal expressions with formal ones.\n\nThird example: \"I considered many approaches.\" Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\" Changed \"considered\" to \"were considered\" (passive) and \"many\" to \"various.\"\n\nFourth example: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" Changed from passive voice (got) to active (understood you).\n\nFifth example: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" As analyzed, changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met.\"\n\nSo combining these observations, possible instructions could include:\n\n1. Replace informal expressions with more formal alternatives (e.g., \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\").\n2. Convert active voice to passive voice where possible (though not all examples are passive).\n3. Change certain adjectives (like \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\").\n4. Adjust pronoun usage in relative clauses by replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met\" to use the objective case.\n5. Replace \"got what you said\" with \"understood you.\"\n\nBut wait, not all examples fit into these categories. For instance, the second example is about replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate,\" which is a synonym in more formal terms. The fourth example is changing from \"got what you said\" to \"understood you,\" which is a different structure entirely. The third example is changing \"considered\" to passive and \"many\" to \"various.\" \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input by expanding or refining the meaning, using synonyms, adjusting grammar, etc. But how to unify these examples under one instruction?\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, many of them seem to make the sentence more formal or elaborate. For example, changing \"fire\" to \"incredibly good\" (more descriptive), \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\" (formal), \"considered\" to passive and \"many\" to \"various\" (more precise), \"got what you said\" to \"understood you\" (directer), and \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" (objective case pronoun). \n\nIf the instruction is to convert informal or conversational language into more formal written English, that could explain the second and fourth examples. However, the first, third, and fifth examples also involve specific transformations.\n\nWait, the fifth example's transformation seems more about grammar than vocabulary. Changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" in a relative clause. So perhaps the instruction includes both changing wording and adjusting grammatical structures.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is a combination of several tasks:\n\n- Replace idiomatic expressions with more formal equivalents.\n- Convert active voice to passive voice where applicable.\n- Adjust pronoun usage in relative clauses by replacing \"met\" with \"whom met.\"\n- Elaborate on adjectives or phrases for clarity.\n\nBut how do these fit into a single instruction? Maybe the overall instruction is to rephrase each input sentence in a more formal and precise manner, making necessary grammatical adjustments, including but not limited to:\n\n- Converting colloquial expressions to standard phrasing.\n- Changing voice (active to passive).\n- Adjusting pronouns in relative clauses.\n- Using more precise or elaborate vocabulary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is more specific, like \"Replace 'fire' with an adjective that describes quality,\" or \"Convert reported speech into direct statements.\" But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother possibility is that the instruction requires the friend to replace the subject pronoun with an object pronoun wherever it appears in the sentence. For example:\n\n- In the first example, \"This song is fire.\" If we follow this rule, maybe the instruction is to replace \"fire\" with \"good\" but that doesn't directly relate. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to replace slang terms with antonyms, but \"fire\" doesn't have a direct antonym here.\n\nWait, maybe the instruction is to replace \"fire\" with \"great,\" but that doesn't align. Alternatively, think of the outputs as more formal versions. For example, \"This song is fire.\" could be rephrased as \"This song is incredibly good,\" which is a way to make it more formal. So maybe the instruction is to make each statement more formal, using more elaborate language where possible.\n\nSimilarly, \"I can't stand his temper\" becomes \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Here, \"tolerate\" is a synonym but more formal. \"Considered many approaches\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" Again, adjusting both the adjectives and the structure.\n\nThe fourth example is about changing reported speech. \"Got what you said\" → \"Understood you.\" So that's converting the reporting style from indirect (\"got\") to direct (\"understood you\").\n\nThe fifth example is about the pronoun adjustment in the relative clause.\n\nPutting all this together, the instruction likely involves multiple steps: making the language more formal, adjusting sentence structure (like voice conversion), refining vocabulary, and correcting pronoun usage in relative clauses. However, since all examples must fit under one instruction, perhaps the instruction is more nuanced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each sentence into the passive voice where applicable, but the examples don't all fit. For example, the first input is active (\"is fire\") → output is active (\"is incredibly good\"). The second input is \"can't stand\" (active) → output is \"cannot tolerate\" (active). Third input is \"considered\" (active) → output is passive. Fourth input is \"got\" (passive?) → output is \"understood\" (active). Fifth input is active → output is passive. So mixed results.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the fifth example's transformation, it's about changing the relative clause from \"I met\" to \"whom I met.\" This could be part of the instruction to use the objective case instead of the subjective case after a preposition. But in this case, the relative clause is after \"was helpful,\" so maybe not a preposition.\n\nWait, in the relative clause \"I met yesterday was helpful,\" the subject is \"I met\" (the person met), which is the subject of the main clause. But since it's a relative clause, the subject is the relative pronoun. So perhaps the instruction is to introduce a relative pronoun when \"I met\" is",

Hmm. So the user provided five input-output examples, and we need to deduce the rule or task that transforms each input into the corresponding output.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the pairs again to see if there's a pattern.\n\nInput 1: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\nInput 2: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\nInput 3: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\nInput 4: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\nInput 5: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n\nLooking at each pair, maybe there's a common transformation or rephrasing strategy used. Let's analyze each one.\n\nStarting with Input 1: Original is an expression of anticipation (\"See you\"), and the output is a more formal or polite response (\"look forward to meeting you\"). So perhaps the instruction is to convert casual expressions into more formal or polite versions?\n\nInput 2: \"Thanks for your help\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Both are expressions of gratitude, but the output uses different phrasing. \"Assistance\" instead of \"help\", \"much appreciated\" vs \"thanks\". So maybe replacing common phrases with synonyms or rephrasing in a more elevated way.\n\nInput 3: \"The whole story was made up\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Here, \"whole\" vs \"entire\", both meaning complete. \"Made up\" is an idiom meaning fabricated, so replacing \"made up\" with a synonym phrase.\n\nInput 4: \"I can't tell the difference between these two\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" Both express difficulty in discerning differences, but the output uses more formal wording. \"Can't tell\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n\nInput 5: \"I considered many approaches\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" The subject is moved from \"I\" to \"approaches\", and \"considered\" is replaced with \"were considered\". So maybe restructuring the sentence to focus on the object (like approaches) rather than the speaker, and using passive voice?\n\nWait, but some other inputs don't fit this exact pattern. For example, Input 3 is just a word replacement (\"whole\" → \"entire\", \"made up\" → \"fabricated\"). But Input 5's transformation is more about changing the sentence structure and voice.\n\nSo maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or professional tone, using synonyms where possible, and sometimes restructuring the sentence for emphasis on the subject.\n\nBut looking closer:\n\nInput 1: Convert casual greeting to formal acknowledgment.\nInput 2: Replace \"help\" with \"assistance\" and \"thanks\" with \"much appreciated\".\nInput 3: Replace idiom \"made up\" with \"fabricated\".\nInput 4: Restructure the sentence from first person to third person, using \"it\" as subject.\nInput 5: Passive voice change from active (\"I considered\") to passive (\"were considered\"), and focus on \"approaches\" instead of \"I\".\n\nHmm. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or impersonal version, possibly using synonyms and altering sentence structure to remove first-person references.\n\nAnother angle: all outputs seem to be in past tense, like Input 1 is \"will meet\" but output is \"look forward to meeting\" which is conditional. Wait, no. Wait, the input is in present tense? Wait, Input 1 is \"See you tonight.\" which is future tense, but output is \"I look forward to meeting...\", which is conditional. Wait, actually, the output uses the simple present tense \"look forward to\", which is often used to express future intentions. So maybe converting future statements into conditional or present tense expressions.\n\nBut Input 3 is past tense: \"was made up\" becomes \"was fabricated\". So maybe past tense handling? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to replace certain words or phrases with synonyms. For example:\n\n- \"See you\" → \"look forward to meeting\"\n- \"Thanks\" → \"assistance\" + \"much appreciated\"\n- \"made up\" → \"fabricated\"\n- \"can't tell the difference\" → \"hard to distinguish\"\n- \"considered many approaches\" → \"various approaches were considered\"\n\nWait, \"I considered\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered.\" So here, the original subject is \"I\" but the output focuses on the approaches, and uses passive voice. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more general statement, removing the first-person reference and using passive voice when possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the task is to rewrite the input in a more formal style, using more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures.\n\nLet's check each output against possible transformation strategies:\n\n1. Formalization: Inputs are rephrased to sound more professional.\n   - Input 1: \"See you\" is made into a formal greeting.\n   - Input 2: Gratitude expressed in a more elaborate way.\n   - Input 3: Idiom \"made up\" replaced with \"fabricated\".\n   - Input 4: Replacing \"can't tell\" with \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n   - Input 5: Active voice becomes passive, and \"I considered\" becomes \"were considered\".\n\nAnother thought: Some outputs seem to involve slight expansions. For example, \"I can't...\" becomes \"I find it hard to distinguish...\". Similarly, \"the whole story was made up\" becomes \"the entire story was fabricated\". These might be cases where the original phrasing is simplified or colloquial, and the output is more precise or academic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the task is to translate the input into a more precise form by replacing idiomatic expressions with their literal or more accurate equivalents. Like \"made up\" (which can mean composed or fabricated) becomes \"fabricated\", which is a stronger term.\n\nSimilarly, \"considered many approaches\" might be rephrased as \"various approaches were considered\" to add more specificity.\n\nPutting this together, the instruction likely involves rephrasing each input into a more formal, precise, or professional version. Possible strategies include:\n\n- Converting casual expressions into more formal or polite language.\n- Replacing idiomatic expressions with their more precise meanings.\n- Changing sentence structure to focus on the subject/object rather than the speaker.\n- Using more elevated vocabulary (e.g., \"assistance\" instead of \"help\").\n- Restructuring sentences to use passive voice or avoid first-person pronouns.\n\nTo confirm, let's test these hypotheses against the examples:\n\nInput 1: \"See you tonight.\" → Formal alternative. \"Look forward to meeting you\" is a standard way to say goodbye in a polite manner, especially in writing.\n\nInput 2: \"Thanks for your help.\" → The output uses \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" This is a more formal way of expressing gratitude, using \"assistance\" and \"much appreciated\" to elevate the tone.\n\nInput 3: \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"Entire\" replaces \"whole\", which is similar. \"Fabricated\" is a synonym for \"made up\", perhaps in the context of fabrication. So replacing the idiom with a direct translation.\n\nInput 4: \"I can't tell the difference\" → \"Find it hard to distinguish\" changes the phrasing from first-person inability to a more general difficulty, possibly using \"it\" as a dummy subject for emphasis.\n\nInput 5: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Changing to \"Various approaches were considered.\" Removes the first-person reference, shifts to passive voice (though not strictly necessary), and adds \"various\" for specificity.\n\nSo combining these observations, the instruction is likely to rephrase each input into a more formal, professional, or precise version by:\n\n- Using more elevated vocabulary.\n- Restructuring sentences to focus on the subject or object rather than the speaker.\n- Replacing idiomatic expressions with their precise equivalents.\n- Altering sentence structure to enhance formality or clarity.\n\nTherefore, the original instruction probably said something like: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal, professional version by replacing casual phrases with more elevated vocabulary, restructuring sentences to avoid first-person pronouns, and using precise terminology where possible.\"\n\nAlternatively, since the outputs vary in transformation types, maybe the instruction was broader, such as: \"Rephrase each input into a more polite or formal response,\" allowing for various rephrasing techniques depending on the context.\n\nBut given the specific examples, another possibility is that the instruction was to convert expressions of gratitude into more formal versions, handle past tense conversions, or handle specific phrases like \"made up.\" However, the fifth example doesn't fit those.\n\nAlternatively, considering the fifth input/output pair, where the original is in the active voice (\"I considered\") and the output is in the passive (\"were considered\"), perhaps the instruction was to convert active voice to passive voice. But looking at other examples, not all are passive. For example, Input 2 becomes \"Your assistance...\" which is active in structure. So that's less likely.\n\nAnother angle: the outputs often start with \"I\" except in Input 3. Wait, no: Input 3 is \"The entire story was fabricated.\" So the output doesn't start with \"I\". So maybe the instruction is to eliminate first-person references. Let's check:\n\nInput 1: \"See you\" becomes \"I look forward...\" (starts with \"I\")\nInput 2: \"Thanks\" becomes \"Your assistance...\" (no \"I\")\nInput 3: \"The whole story...\" becomes \"The entire story...\" (no \"I\")\nInput 4: \"I can't...\" becomes \"I find it...\" (starts with \"I\")\nInput 5: \"I considered...\" becomes \"Various approaches...\" (no \"I\")\n\nSo some start with \"I\", others don't. So maybe not all about eliminating \"I\". But Input 2 and 3 do. Maybe the instruction is to either keep or eliminate \"I\" based on context? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a third-person perspective, making the focus on the subject rather than the speaker. In Input 2, \"your help\" becomes \"Your assistance\", but the subject remains \"your\" (third person). Input 3 is a statement without personal pronouns. Input 1 becomes \"I look forward...\", starting with \"I\". So that might not be the case.\n\nHmm. Another observation: the first example's output starts with \"I look forward to...\" while the input is a greeting. The second example turns a direct thank you into a more elaborate gratitude statement. The third is a straightforward substitution of \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\". The fourth turns \"can't tell\" into \"find it hard to distinguish\", and the fifth converts active to passive, removes \"I\".\n\nPutting this together, the instruction might be a combination of tasks, but the most consistent theme seems to be rephrasing for formality, precision, and avoiding colloquialisms. The fifth example specifically involves passive voice and restructuring around the subject.\n\nBut how to tie all this into a single instruction? Maybe the instruction was to \"rephrase each input into a more formal or professional tone by replacing informal expressions with more elevated vocabulary, restructuring sentences where appropriate, and eliminating first-person pronouns when possible.\"\n\nAlternatively, considering that some examples involve changing verbs (like \"can't tell\" to \"find it hard to distinguish\") and others change nouns (whole to entire), it's possible the instruction was to replace certain key terms with their more precise counterparts while maintaining the overall structure.\n\nWait, looking at the fifth example: \"I considered many approaches\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" The subject changes from \"I\" to \"approaches\", and the voice changes from active to passive. This seems to be a general rule: turning active voice into passive or focusing on the object.\n\nSo maybe the instruction was to convert the sentence to focus on the subject (often an object) rather than the speaker, and to use passive voice when possible.\n\nTesting this hypothesis against the examples:\n\nInput 1: \"See you\" → \"I look forward to meeting you\" – doesn't fit. Unless \"you\" is the focus. Wait, but the output is about the speaker looking forward, so maybe not.\n\nInput 2: \"Your help\" becomes \"Your assistance\". Maybe not a subject shift.\n\nInput 3: Focus remains on the story, no shift.\n\nInput 4: Focus shifts from \"I\" to \"them\".\n\nInput 5: Shifts from \"I\" to \"approaches\".\n\nSo only some examples shift the subject, not all. For instance, Input 3 stays the same subject (story), Input 2 stays the same (your help). So that might not be the main focus.\n\nAnother idea: the instruction was to translate the input into a more precise or accurate form by replacing common phrases with their exact meanings. For example, \"made up\" as a lie → \"fabricated\", \"can't tell the difference\" → \"have difficulty distinguishing\".\n\nThis seems to apply to Input 3 and 4. Input 5 replaces \"many approaches\" with \"various approaches\". So maybe the instruction was to rephrase vague terms (like \"many\") into more specific ones, and to use precise verbs and nouns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the task was to make the output more grammatically complex. For example, changing \"I can't tell\" to \"It's hard to distinguish\".\n\nBut why does Input 1 have \"look forward to\" which is a more complex structure than \"see you\"?\n\nPerhaps the instruction was to convert the input into a more polite or formal expression, often involving longer, more structured sentences. For example, changing a direct address like \"See you\" into a longer clause expressing anticipation.\n\nIn summary, after analyzing all possibilities, the most consistent instruction seems to be: **\"Rewrite each input into a more formal or polite version by replacing casual expressions with more elevated vocabulary, restructuring sentences to focus on the subject or object rather than the speaker, and using precise terminology where possible.\"**\n\nBut to be precise, considering the fifth example's transformation (active to passive and removal of \"I\"), maybe the instruction was specifically about rephrasing active sentences into passive ones, but that doesn't fit all examples. Alternatively, the instruction could have been more general about rephrasing for formality and clarity, including varied techniques like synonym substitution, sentence restructuring, and voice changes.\n\nAnother possibility: the instruction was to generate a response that conveys the same meaning but in a way that is more professional or avoids informal language. Examples support this, as the outputs are often more formal in tone, use synonyms, and adjust sentence structure.\n\nGiven that the user mentioned the instruction was given to a friend, who produced these outputs, the most logical instruction would be to rephrase each input into a more formal or professional version, using appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure. The various transformations across examples suggest that the instruction encompassed multiple aspects of language modification aimed at enhancing formality, clarity, and precision.\n\nThus, the final answer is that the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version using synonyms, adjusting sentence structure, and emphasizing professional language.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to the friend was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version**, employing the following strategies:\n\n1. **Synonym Replacement**: Replace casual or informal terms with more elevated vocabulary (e.g., \"help\" → \"assistance\", \"made up\" → \"fabricated\").\n2. **Sentence Restructuring**: Shift focus from the speaker (\"I\") to the subject/object, altering sentence structure (e.g., \"I considered many approaches\" → \"Various approaches were considered\").\n3. **Polite/Grammatical Adjustments**: Convert direct addresses or first-person references into more formal phrasing (e.g., \"See you\" → \"I look forward to...\").\n4. **Precision**: Use precise terminology to clarify intent (e.g., \"can't tell\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\", \"whole\" → \"entire\").\n\n**Final Instruction:**  \n\"Rewrite each input into a more formal or polite response by replacing casual expressions with elevated vocabulary, restructuring sentences to emphasize the subject/object, and enhancing clarity through precise language.\" \n\nEach output reflects these principles, transforming inputs into more professional, grammatically complex, and contextually appropriate versions.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs, and from these examples, I need to deduce the pattern or rule that was followed. Let me start by analyzing each pair carefully.\n\nFirst, let me list them again to have a clear view:\n\n1. Input: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n2. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n3. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n4. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n5. Input: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\"\n\nLooking at these, there are different types of inputs: some are direct statements, some are questions, some are thanks, complaints, etc. The outputs vary in structure. Let me see if there's a common transformation applied here.\n\nStarting with the first example: The input is a greeting (\"See you\"), and the output is a more formal response (\"I look forward to...\"). So maybe the instruction is to convert casual phrases into more polite or formal expressions? But wait, the second input is a question asking for accompaniment, and the output changes \"do you want\" to \"shall I,\" which is a bit more formal and uses a suggestion phrasing instead of a question. Hmm, but that's a specific change for that input. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence in a more elegant or professional way, perhaps replacing certain verbs or changing the sentence structure?\n\nThird example: Input is a thank you, and the output is a more elaborate expression of gratitude. The fourth input is a complaint about someone's temper, and the output rephrases it as \"cannot tolerate\" instead of \"can't stand.\" The fifth input is a confirmation, and the output changes \"got what you said\" to \"understood you.\" So here, the verb \"got\" becomes \"understood,\" and \"what you said\" is omitted. Wait, but \"got\" might be a colloquial way of saying \"understood\" in some contexts. Alternatively, \"got what you said\" could be phrased as \"understood your statement,\" but in this case, they removed \"what you said.\"\n\nSo maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into more standard, polite, or professional language. Let's check each example against that idea.\n\nFirst input: Casual greeting becomes formal/inviting. That fits.\n\nSecond input: A question transformed into a more formal \"shall I...\" which is still a question but in a different form. So perhaps replacing \"do you want...\" with \"shall I...\" in such contexts.\n\nThird input: Changing \"thanks\" into a more detailed \"assistance is much appreciated.\" That seems like a more formal version.\n\nFourth input: \"Can't stand\" is changed to \"cannot tolerate,\" which is more neutral in tone and perhaps less direct.\n\nFifth input: \"Got what you said\" becomes \"understood you.\" Here, the original is informal, and the output is a more precise expression of understanding without specifying \"what you said.\"\n\nNow, considering all these transformations, maybe the overall instruction is to rephrase the input into a more polite, formal, or grammatically correct version. However, some changes are more nuanced. For instance, replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\" might be part of avoiding strong expressions, but that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to translate the input into a more elegant or sophisticated equivalent using synonyms or restructuring. Let's check each transformation again:\n\n1. \"See you\" → \"look forward to meeting you\": \"see you\" is a casual phrase, replaced with a more formal expression of anticipation.\n2. \"Do you want...\" → \"Shall I...\" : The original is a request; the output changes the wording to a suggestion phrased as a question. This could be part of making it more polite (\"Would you like me to go...?\") but here it's transformed into \"Shall I...\", which is more formal and slightly less direct.\n3. \"Thanks...\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated\": The input is a simple thanks, and the output expands it into a more detailed expression of gratitude.\n4. \"I can't stand...\" → \"I cannot tolerate...\": The original is informal; the output uses a synonym with a slightly more formal tone.\n5. \"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\" Here, \"got\" is replaced with \"understood,\" and \"what you said\" is omitted. This seems to be simplifying the phrasing while maintaining the meaning.\n\nLooking for a common thread across all these transformations. It's possible that the instruction is to rephrase the input in a more polite or formal style. Let's test this hypothesis against each input.\n\nFor example, the third input is a direct thank you. Rephrasing into a more elaborate form makes sense for politeness or formality. The fourth input's transformation from \"can't stand\" to \"tolerate\" might be part of softening the statement. The second input's transformation uses \"shall I\" which is a more formal and less direct way to ask for accompaniment. The first input turns a casual greeting into a more formal response. The fifth input replaces \"got\" with \"understood,\" which might be considered more correct grammar or a more precise expression of understanding.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more sophisticated version using elevated vocabulary or proper grammar. However, in some cases, like the fourth example, the output uses a synonym but keeps the same structure. For example, \"can't stand\" vs. \"tolerate\"—both are negative, but \"tolerate\" is more formal.\n\nWait, but in the second example, \"do you want...\" becomes \"shall I...\". That's a different structure: changing a question into a suggestion phrased as a question. That's a key difference here. So maybe the instruction is to convert questions into suggestions phrased in a certain way? Let's check that possibility.\n\nFor example:\nOriginal question: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" \nOutput: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n\nSo here, the original is a yes/no question, transformed into a tag question (\"Shall I...?\"), which is a common way to make a suggestion. But in other examples, the output isn't a question. For instance, the third input is a statement, not a question, but the output is also a statement.\n\nHmm. So maybe the instruction isn't just about questions. Another thought: Perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal version by changing the sentence structure, using more polite language, and perhaps replacing certain words.\n\nAlternatively, looking at all the outputs, there's a tendency towards using \"I\" statements, which most of the outputs do. Except for the fourth input, where the input is \"I can't stand...\" and the output is \"I cannot tolerate...\" which also uses \"I.\" So maybe the instruction was to rewrite the input in the first person, using appropriate modifiers or phrasing.\n\nBut that doesn't fit all examples. For example, the third input's output starts with \"Your assistance is...\" which is a third-person statement. So that breaks the \"I\" approach.\n\nWait, in the third input's output, \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" is addressed to the listener, but the input was a first-person thanks. So maybe the instruction wasn't strictly about changing perspective.\n\nLet me consider another angle: perhaps the outputs are translations of the inputs into more refined English, perhaps even in another language, but given that all outputs are in English, that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the outputs are rephrased using different tenses or modes. For example, the fourth input is present tense in both input and output, but the second example changes \"want\" (present) to \"accompany\" (infinitive). Not sure.\n\nLooking at the outputs, several changes are made:\n\n- \"See you\" → \"I look forward to meeting you\" (changing to a future verb phrase)\n- \"Do you want...\" → \"Shall I...\" (changing from a question to a suggestion phrased as a question)\n- \"Thanks...\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" (rephrasing gratitude into a more formal structure)\n- \"I can't stand...\" → \"I cannot tolerate...\" (synonym substitution)\n- \"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\" (verb replacement and omission)\n\nNow, if we look for a pattern across these transformations, perhaps the instruction is to convert the input into a more formal or elegant version. However, the second example is a question transformed into a suggestion, which is a structural change. The first example changes the phrase from casual to formal.\n\nBut why does the first example turn \"see you\" into \"look forward to meeting you\"? That's a specific rephrasing. Similarly, \"can't stand\" to \"tolerate\" seems like a matter of euphemism.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more polite version, possibly avoiding contractions. For instance, changing \"can't\" to \"cannot,\" but the fourth input's output does that. The second example's output uses \"shall I\" instead of \"do you want,\" which is a way to make a request more polite.\n\nIn the third example, changing \"thanks\" to \"your assistance is appreciated\" is expanding the meaning rather than making it more formal.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that the instruction is to translate the input into a more formal and precise version, possibly using more complete sentences or different phrasing. But how to encapsulate this into a single instruction?\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to respond with a more sophisticated or elegant version, perhaps using higher-level vocabulary or more precise diction. For example:\n\n\"Your task is to take each input and rephrase it into a more formal, polite, and grammatically correct version, ensuring clarity and elegance.\"\n\nBut that's quite a mouthful. To see if this matches the examples:\n\nFirst input: Casual greeting → formal response. Check.\n\nSecond input: Question → polite suggestion. Check.\n\nThird input: Simple thanks → elaborate gratitude. Check.\n\nFourth input: Complaint → softer expression. Check.\n\nFifth input: Informal agreement → more precise understanding. Check.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the instruction might be something like \"polite and formal restatement\" or \"rephrase into a more formal and elegant version.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more polished version using synonyms or proper grammar. For instance, replacing contractions, using more formal tenses, etc.\n\nBut let's test this hypothesis. If the instruction was to make the output more formal and elegant, then each of the examples would fit. For example:\n\n- \"See you\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you\" – formal and anticipatory.\n- \"Do you want...\" becomes \"Shall I...\" – polite request.\n- \"Thanks...\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" – formal and detailed.\n- \"Can't stand...\" becomes \"Cannot tolerate...\" – using \"cannot\" (more formal) and \"tolerate\" (less direct).\n- \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\" – \"got\" is colloquial, replaced with \"understood\" (more standard).\n\nYes, this seems to align. The key points are using formal language, avoiding contractions where possible, replacing informal expressions with more elevated synonyms, and structuring sentences in a more polite and complete manner.\n\nTherefore, the instruction likely was: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, and grammatically correct version, emphasizing clarity and precision.\"\n\nBut the problem is that the user might have given a shorter, more specific instruction. However, based on the examples, the instruction seems to focus on transforming the input into a more formal, polite, and grammatically accurate response, possibly using synonyms or restructuring sentences to enhance elegance or formality.\n\nAnother possible instruction could be to translate the input into a more sophisticated version by replacing certain words or phrases with their formal equivalents. For example, \"can't stand\" becomes \"tolerate,\" \"got what you said\" becomes \"understood you,\" etc.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to generate a response that is a more refined version of the input, maintaining the original intent but expressed in a more elegant way. For instance, changing \"See you\" to \"I look forward to meeting you\" is a more elaborated and anticipatory response.\n\nConsidering all possibilities, the most comprehensive instruction that fits all examples is to rephrase the input into a more formal, polite, and grammatically precise version. Therefore, the original instruction could have been along the lines of:\n\n\"Take each input and rephrase it into a more formal, polite, and grammatically correct version, ensuring clarity and elegance.\"\n\nAlternatively, if the instruction was shorter, maybe:\n\n\"Polish each response into a more refined and polite form.\"\n\nBut given the examples, the first longer version seems more accurate.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction given to the friend was to **rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, and grammatically correct version**, emphasizing clarity and precision. This involved transforming casual or informal expressions into more sophisticated, elegant language while maintaining the original meaning. \n\n**Key transformations observed:**\n1. **Formalizing greetings**: Converting casual phrases like \"See you\" into polite invitations (\"I look forward to meeting you\").\n2. **Polishing questions**: Replacing direct queries (e.g., \"Do you want...\") with formal suggestions (\"Shall I...\").\n3. **Enhancing gratitude**: Expanding simple thanks (e.g., \"Thanks for your help\") into elaborate expressions of appreciation.\n4. **Elevating vocabulary**: Substituting informal terms (e.g., \"can't stand\") with more formal synonyms (\"tolerate\") or refining collocations (\"got what you said\" → \"understood you\").\n5. **Maintaining structure**: Preserving sentence completeness and grammatical correctness while restructuring phrases for elegance.\n\nThus, the underlying instruction focused on refining communication through formality, politeness, and linguistic precision. \n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, and grammatically precise version**, enhancing clarity and elegance. Examples include converting casual greetings into polite invitations, rewording questions into formal suggestions, and elevating everyday language with more refined vocabulary.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs, and they want to figure out the original instruction given to their friend. So, I need to analyze each pair and find a pattern or rule that transforms the input into the output. Then, combine those patterns to determine what the general instruction might have been.\n\nStarting with the first input-output pair:\nInput: Can you do all these tasks?\nOutput: Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\n\nHmm, comparing these two. Let's break them down. The original question is \"Can you do all these tasks?\" which is asking for ability. The output is \"Would you be able to accomplish...\" which uses \"would\" instead of \"can\" but still conveys ability in the past or hypothetical sense. But the structure here seems to replace \"do\" with \"be able to accomplish\". Wait, no. Let me check again. The input is \"Can you do...\", and the output is \"Would you be able to accomplish...\". Wait, the output starts with \"Would\", not \"Can\". So maybe there's a different transformation here. Maybe the original instruction was about rephrasing questions into statements, but in a way that changes the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction was to convert certain phrases into others. Let's look at other examples.\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: She looks like her sister.\nOutput: She resembles her sister.\n\nHere, \"looks like\" is replaced with \"resembles\". So maybe the instruction is to replace certain phrasal verbs with their synonyms. For example, replacing \"look like\" with \"resemble\".\n\nThird input:\nI got what you said.\nOutput: I understood you.\n\nOriginal is present tense, input: \"got what you said\" (past tense). Output is \"understood you\" (past tense, but more formal). So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentence using a more formal version of the verb. \"Got\" can mean understand, but in some contexts. \"Understood you\" is more direct. Maybe replacing informal expressions with more standard ones.\n\nFourth input:\nI think that this is interesting.\nOutput: It is my opinion that this is interesting.\n\nOriginal is a subjective statement (\"I think...\"). The output rephrases it as \"It is my opinion...\". So perhaps the instruction was to change first-person thoughts into third-person opinions or statements of belief. Also, changing \"this is\" to \"is my opinion that this is\".\n\nFifth input:\nThe whole story was made up.\nOutput: The entire story was fabricated.\n\nOriginal uses \"made up\" (which can mean fabricated in context), but the output uses \"fabricated\". So maybe the instruction was to replace certain collocations with their synonyms. \"Made up\" → \"fabricated\".\n\nNow, looking for common threads across all these transformations. Let's list each input-output pair and see the changes:\n\n1. Input: Can you...? → Output: Would you be able to...?\n   - Changed \"Can you\" to \"Would you be able to\". So replacing \"can\" with \"be able to\" in conditional form. Or perhaps transforming questions into conditional statements.\n\n2. She looks like → She resembles\n   - Synonym substitution for \"looks like\"\n\n3. I got what you said → I understood you\n   - Replacing \"got\" (as in received or understood) with \"understood\"\n\n4. I think that... → It is my opinion that...\n   - Converting first-person thoughts into objective statements of opinion\n\n5. The whole story was made up → The entire story was fabricated\n   - Replacing \"made up\" with \"fabricated\"\n\nSo, combining these observations, possible instructions could involve various linguistic transformations. Let's try to find a common instruction that would cover all these examples.\n\nPossible instruction candidates:\n\n- Rephrase each input into a more formal or standard version of the sentence.\n- Convert all instances of \"can\" into \"be able to\" in conditional statements.\n- Replace informal expressions with their synonyms (like \"look like\" → \"resemble\").\n- Convert subjectivity (\"I think\") to objectivity (\"it is my opinion\").\n- Change parts of speech or sentence structure (like making \"whole\" into \"entire\").\n\nLooking at the first example, the input is a question asking ability, and the output is a conditional statement expressing possibility. That suggests converting questions about capability into conditional statements using \"would be able to\". Similarly, in the second example, the output uses a synonym. Third example uses a more formal verb. Fourth example converts to a statement of opinion. Fifth example replaces a phrase with its synonym.\n\nBut how does all these fit under one instruction? Let's consider that the original instruction was to \"Rephrase each input into a more formal or objective version by replacing certain phrases or structures.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to \"Convert each input into its synonym or more standard phrasing.\" But that seems too vague. Let's look for a more precise instruction.\n\nAnother angle: Each output seems to be a rephrased version with slight modifications. The first example changes \"can\" to \"be able to\" and the question to conditional. Second example swaps \"look like\" for \"resemble\". Third changes \"got\" to \"understood\". Fourth turns \"I think\" into \"my opinion\". Fifth replaces \"made up\" with \"fabricated\".\n\nIf we group these, the instruction might be something like: \"Replace each occurrence of informal or specific phrases with their more formal or standard equivalents, including replacing certain verbs, phrases, and restructuring sentences as needed.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to rephrase each input by converting subjective statements to objective ones, replacing certain collocations, and adjusting verb forms.\n\nWait, but the first example isn't just replacing a phrase; it's converting a question into a conditional. So maybe the instruction was more about restructuring sentences rather than just substituting words.\n\nLooking back at the first example: Original question \"Can you do all these tasks?\" becomes \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" Here, \"can\" is replaced with \"be able to\", \"do\" becomes \"accomplish\", and the question becomes a conditional. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input by converting \"can\" into \"be able to\" and replacing the base verb with a synonym. However, in the first example, the verb \"do\" isn't a synonym of \"accomplish\"; they're different verbs. So maybe that approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to turn questions into statements by changing the structure. For example, taking \"Can you X?\" and turning it into \"You would be able to X if...\". But that doesn't exactly match the first output. The first output is \"Would you be able to...?\" but that's a question. Wait, no—wait, the input is a question, the output is a question but with different phrasing.\n\nWait, the first input is a question, and the output is also a question but rephrased. Let's check that:\n\nInput: Can you do all these tasks?\nOutput: Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\n\nOriginal question is about capability (can you perform the tasks?), output is a conditional question implying ability (would you be able to accomplish them if...). Hmm, so maybe the instruction was to rephrase each question into a conditional statement using \"be able to\". But why \"could\" or \"would\" wasn't used? Like, if the input is a question, output is a conditional statement with \"be able to\". But in the first case, \"can\" became \"be able to\". Wait, but in the input, the verb is \"do\", so maybe the instruction is to replace \"can\" with \"be able to\" and restructure the question into a conditional. But the first output is a question, whereas the input was a question. That complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input by converting it into a similar question but with a different structure. For example, turning \"Can you...\" into \"Would you be able to...\" but keeping it as a question. But then why the fourth output is a statement?\n\nWait, the fourth input is \"I think that this is interesting.\" Output is \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" So here, a statement is converted into another statement. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a similar statement but using different words or structures. Like replacing \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion\".\n\nLooking back at the fifth example: \"The whole story was made up.\" becomes \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Here, \"whole\" → \"entire\", \"made up\" → \"fabricated\". So replacing nouns and collocations.\n\nSo, considering all the examples, the instruction likely required rephrasing each input into a more formal, objective, or structured version by replacing certain words or phrases, adjusting verb forms, and changing sentence structures when necessary. For instance, converting questions about capability into conditional statements, replacing informal expressions with synonyms, adjusting possessives, etc.\n\nPutting it all together, the original instruction probably was: \"Rewrite each input by converting questions about capability into conditional statements using 'would be able to', replacing informal expressions with more formal synonyms, adjusting possessive pronouns and nouns where applicable, and structuring the sentences appropriately.\"\n\nAlternatively, a more concise instruction could be: \"Rephrase each input into a similar statement using more formal language, including replacing 'can' with 'be able to' in questions about capability and adjusting other phrases as needed.\"\n\nBut let's check if that covers all the examples.\n\nFirst example: Question about capability → Conditional statement with \"be able to\". Yes.\n\nSecond example: \"looks like\" → \"resembles\". Informal to formal.\n\nThird: \"got\" → \"understood\".

Hmm, each input is transformed into a corresponding output. Let me go through them one by one and see if I can spot a pattern or common transformation.\n\nFirst pair: Input \"See you tonight.\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" So, the output starts with \"I look forward to\" where the input has \"See you\". That makes sense because \"see you\" is a casual greeting, and \"look forward to meeting you\" is more formal or perhaps a more polite alternative. But wait, the original input uses \"See you\", which is similar to \"I see you\" but usually used as a farewell. Wait, no—actually, \"see you\" is a common way to say goodbye, like \"I'll see you later.\" But the output here is about looking forward to meeting, which is more like anticipating a future meeting rather than a farewell. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal expression? Or maybe there's a different nuance here.\n\nSecond input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output is \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" So here, the verb changes from \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\". Both mean disliking something, but \"tolerate\" is a bit more neutral. Alternatively, maybe it's a synonym substitution? Not exactly synonyms, but related. Another possibility is changing the sentence structure from \"can't do X\" to \"cannot do X\".\n\nThird input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" Here, the input uses \"I think\" which is a personal belief, and the output replaces it with \"It is my opinion\". So maybe the instruction was to rephrase expressions of personal opinion into a more formal or indirect statement, often using \"it is my opinion that...\" instead of \"I think that...\".\n\nFourth input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" So \"made up\" here probably means \"fabricated\" in the sense of being invented or untrue. So replacing \"made up\" (which can also mean composed of parts) with \"fabricated\" as the correct meaning here. So the instruction might be to replace certain phrasal verbs or collocations with their precise synonyms or correct meanings, especially when they might have different interpretations.\n\nFifth input: \"She looks like her sister.\" Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" So \"looks like\" is a colloquial way to say \"resembles\". Again, replacing a casual expression with a more formal synonym. \n\nPutting all these together, the common thread seems to be transforming informal or conversational expressions into more formal, polite, or standardized alternatives. Each input uses a phrase that's often used in casual conversation, and the output provides a more formal or standard version. For example:\n\n- \"see you\" → \"look forward to meeting you\"\n- \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\"\n- \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion\"\n- \"was made up\" → \"was fabricated\" (assuming \"made up\" here means \"fabricated\")\n- \"looks like\" → \"resembles\"\n\nSo the instruction might be asking to rephrase the input into a more formal, polite, or standardized version, replacing conversational expressions with their more formal equivalents. Alternatively, it could be to transform certain phrases into their precise meanings, like when \"made up\" is meant to imply fabricated rather than just composed.\n\nAnother angle: checking if all outputs are direct translations or part of a larger pattern. For instance, some outputs start with \"I\" followed by a verb phrase, while others use \"It is my opinion that...\" So maybe the instruction requires restructuring the sentence in a specific way, perhaps to make it sound more professional or to conform to a certain style guide.\n\nWait, let's look at the first output again: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" The original input is \"See you tonight.\" In some contexts, \"see you\" can be a way to say goodbye, but here, the output is more like \"looking forward to seeing you,\" which is anticipation rather than farewelling. So maybe the instruction was to change expressions of farewells into expressions of looking forward to a future meeting. Similarly, \"can't stand\" is changed to \"cannot tolerate,\" which might be a more formal or legal term depending on context. But maybe in this case, the key is replacing the colloquial verbs with more formal ones.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to replace certain phrases with their antonyms or opposites. For example, \"can't stand\" vs. \"tolerate\" (if \"tolerate\" is seen as a less strong form of putting up with). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's about changing the sentence structure: the original inputs often have \"I + verb phrase\", and the outputs sometimes start with \"It is my opinion\" or \"I look forward to...\" So the instruction could be to rephrase sentences by altering the subject or starting the sentence differently, making it more formal or indirect.\n\nBut let's check the fifth input. \"She looks like her sister.\" Output is \"She resembles her sister.\" So \"resembles\" is a synonym, but perhaps in some contexts, \"resembles\" is more appropriate than \"looks like,\" especially if \"like\" is being used in a metaphorical sense or when talking about physical traits. But the original uses \"looks like,\" which is correct, so why replace it? Maybe the instruction was to use a synonym to avoid repetition or for stylistic reasons. However, since \"she looks like her sister\" is grammatically correct, perhaps the substitution isn't necessary unless there's a mistake in the original. But the input seems correct, so maybe the instruction is to replace \"looks like\" with another synonym for variety or style, even if redundant. But that seems unlikely as a general instruction.\n\nSo, considering all the examples, the most consistent transformation seems to be replacing colloquial expressions with their more formal or precise counterparts. For example:\n\n1. Colloquial: \"see you\" → Formal/Polite: \"look forward to meeting you\"\n2. \"can't stand\" → Formal: \"cannot tolerate\"\n3. \"I think\" → Formal: \"It is my opinion that...\"\n4. \"was made up\" → Corrected to \"was fabricated\" (assuming \"made up\" here means fabricated)\n5. \"looks like\" → Formal synonym: \"resembles\"\n\nIf that's the case, then the instruction was likely to rephrase the input into more formal or polite language by replacing common expressions with their precise or alternative forms. Alternatively, perhaps it's about correcting grammar or vocabulary, such as changing \"see you\" (which can sometimes be incorrect in certain contexts) to a more formal greeting. For instance, \"see you\" is informal, so the output might be trying to make it more formal by using \"look forward to meeting you.\"\n\nAnother thought: maybe the instruction was to rewrite the input into a different voice or perspective. For example, changing first-person statements into third-person (\"I think\" → \"It is my opinion\"), but only in the third example. The others don't fit that pattern. So that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be about replacing certain phrases with their definitions or paraphrasing. For example, explaining what \"made up\" means in context. But in the fourth input, \"was made up\" is changed to \"was fabricated,\" implying that \"made up\" here refers to the story being fabricated. If the original was correct, but the instruction required replacing \"made up\" with \"fabricated,\" perhaps because \"made up\" can also mean composed of parts, but in this context, it's the correct meaning.\n\nSo, considering all possibilities, the most plausible instruction is to rephrase the input into more formal, polite, or standardized language by replacing conversational expressions with their more formal equivalents, adjusting sentence structure where needed, and correcting potential ambiguities or incorrect usages (like \"made up\" vs. \"fabricated\"). The examples show a mix of both: some are direct replacements (like \"see you\" to \"look forward to\"), others involve changing the sentence structure (like changing \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\"), and others are about choosing the correct synonym (e.g., \"tolerate\" over \"stand\").\n\nTherefore, the instruction was probably something like: \"Rewrite the sentence using more formal or polite language, replacing informal expressions with their more standard equivalents.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to rephrase each input into **more formal, polite, or standardized language**, replacing informal or conversational expressions with their more precise or professional equivalents. This involves adjustments such as:\n\n1. **Rephrasing expressions of farewells** (e.g., \"see you\" → \"look forward to meeting you\").\n2. **Substituting synonyms for stronger negation** (e.g., \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\").\n3. **Converting personal opinions into formal statements** (e.g., \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion\").\n4. **Clarifying ambiguous phrasing** (e.g., \"was made up\" → \"was fabricated\" when the intent is to mean \"invented\").\n5. **Replacing casual comparisons with formal terms** (e.g., \"looks like\" → \"resembles\").\n\nIn summary, the task was to enhance the formality and clarity of each input by adhering to stylistic and linguistic conventions.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs where each input has been transformed into an output by a friend following some instruction. My job is to figure out what that instruction could be. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze each pair to find common patterns or transformations. Let me start with the first one: \"I can't stand his temper\" becomes \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" So \"can't stand\" is changed to \"cannot tolerate.\" That makes sense because both mean similar things—disliking something intensely.\n\nSecond pair: \"I can't tell the difference between these two\" becomes \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" Here, \"can't tell the difference\" is rephrased as \"find it hard to distinguish.\" Both express difficulty in distinguishing. But the structure changes from \"can't + verb\" to \"find it hard to + gerund.\"\n\nThird input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" \"Made up\" means created or invented. Fabricated is another term for that. But \"whole\" becomes \"entire,\" which is more formal. So maybe the instruction is to replace informal expressions with their more formal equivalents?\n\nFourth input: \"She looks like her sister.\" Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" \"Looks like\" is changed to \"resembles,\" which is a synonym but perhaps more formal or specific.\n\nFifth input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" Here, the response is transformed from a colloquial \"got what you said\" (meaning I understand) to \"understood you.\" The original might not even be grammatically correct, but the output uses a more standard phrasing.\n\nLooking for common elements here: replacing contractions with non-contracted forms (\"can't\" → \"cannot\"), changing phrasal verbs or idiomatic expressions to synonyms (e.g., \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\"), modifying informal structures to more formal ones (\"made up\" to \"fabricated\"), replacing some phrasal verbs with their base forms or synonyms (\"look like\" to \"resemble\"), and converting informal affirmative responses (\"got what you said\") into more standard ones (\"understood you\").\n\nWait, but the fifth example's input is \"I got what you said.\" The output is \"I understood you.\" The input uses a colloquial contraction, but the output is a more direct and grammatically complete sentence. So perhaps the instruction is to convert casual phrases to more formal or standard English, replacing contractions, expanding some phrases, and using more precise vocabulary.\n\nLet me check other examples for such patterns. First input: \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate.\" Second: \"can't tell the difference\" to \"find it hard to distinguish.\" Third: \"was made up\" to \"was fabricated.\" Fourth: \"looks like\" to \"resembles.\" Fifth: \"got what you said\" to \"understood you.\"\n\nSo in each case, the output is a more formal version. \"Cannot\" vs. \"can't,\" replacing idiomatic expressions with their more formal counterparts, converting informal phrases to standard English, using more precise synonyms.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the instruction was to translate from a less formal to a more formal register. For example, converting spoken language to written language with appropriate formality. Let's verify this hypothesis with all examples.\n\n1. \"I can't stand\" → \"I cannot tolerate.\" Yes, more formal.\n2. \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish.\" Formal replacement.\n3. \"was made up\" → \"was fabricated.\" More formal.\n4. \"She looks like\" → \"She resembles.\" More formal.\n5. \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you.\" More formal and grammatical correction.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Another possible instruction could be to replace certain words with their antonyms or opposites, but looking at the examples, none seem to fit. For instance, \"stand\" vs. \"tolerate\" are synonyms here, not opposites. Similarly, \"tell the difference\" vs. \"distinguish\"—these are synonyms. So that idea doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence using a different structure while maintaining the same meaning. For example, changing from \"can't X\" to \"cannot Y,\" or using a passive voice where applicable.\n\nWait, the third example: \"The whole story was made up\" becomes \"The entire story was fabricated.\" \"Whole\" is replaced with \"entire,\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\" So both are synonyms. So it's not a literal translation but a synonym substitution for common phrases.\n\nIn the second example, \"can't tell the difference\" is changed to \"find it hard to distinguish,\" which is a paraphrase but maintains the core meaning. Similarly, \"made up\" is replaced with \"fabricated,\" another synonym.\n\nSo the pattern is replacing common informal or collocational phrases with their more formal counterparts. This includes:\n\n- Contractions (\"can't\" to \"cannot\")\n- Idiomatic expressions (\"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\", \"can't tell the difference\" to \"find it hard to distinguish\")\n- Common phrases (\"was made up\" to \"was fabricated\")\n- Colloquial verb forms (\"looks like\" to \"resembles\")\n- Informal affirmative statements (\"got what you said\" to \"understood you\")\n\nTherefore, the instruction likely involves transforming the input into a more formal and standard version of English by replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents, expanding contractions, using synonyms, etc.\n\nTo confirm, let's check each pair against this hypothesis:\n\n1. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Correct, replacing the contraction and the idiom with a synonym.\n2. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" Correct, replacing \"can't tell\" with a more formal phrase.\n3. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Correct, replacing informal \"whole\" with \"entire\" and the phrasal verb with its synonym.\n4. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" Correct, replacing the colloquial \"look like\" with the synonym \"resemble.\"\n5. Input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" Correct, converting the casual expression into a more standard and grammatically complete sentence.\n\nAll examples align with this hypothesis. Therefore, the instruction was to convert the input into a more formal version of the sentence, replacing informal or conversational expressions with their more standard counterparts.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **convert the input sentences into a more formal version** of Standard English by:\n\n1. **Replacing informal contractions** with their non-contracted equivalents (e.g., \"can't\" → \"cannot\").\n2. **Rephrasing idiomatic or colloquial expressions** with their more formal synonyms:\n   - \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\"\n   - \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\"\n   - \"look like\" → \"resemble\"\n3. **Substituting synonyms for informal phrasal verbs** (e.g., \"made up\" → \"fabricated\").\n4. **Correcting informal affirmative responses** into grammatically complete and precise statements (e.g., \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\").\n\nBy applying these transformations, the outputs align with a higher level of formal register, typical of written English rather than spoken language.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

So the friend took five input sentences and transformed them into corresponding outputs. My job is to reverse-engineer what the original instruction was that would lead someone to produce those outputs from the inputs.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the input-output pairs again to see if I can spot any patterns or transformations applied.\n\n1. Input: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\"\n   - Let's break this down. The input uses \"got\" as a synonym for understanding. The output replaces \"got\" with \"understood.\" Also, \"what you said\" becomes \"you\" (dropping \"what\"). Hmm, maybe looking for synonyms or rephrasing parts of the sentence.\n\n2. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n   - \"Looks like\" is a common phrase meaning resembling. The output uses \"resembles,\" which is a synonym. So maybe replacing specific collocations with their synonyms.\n\n3. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n   - This changes the structure of the question. The input is in the present tense with \"do you want me...\" The output is a conditional \"shall I...\" which is more formal. Perhaps converting questions into different structures, using \"shall\" instead of \"do you want,\" and changing the verb form.\n\n4. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n   - \"Whole\" vs. \"entire\" – both mean complete, but \"entire\" is more formal. \"Made up\" vs. \"fabricated\" – both imply creating something not true. So here, replacing words with their more formal counterparts.\n\n5. Input: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n   - \"Once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival.\" Again, replacing phrases with more formal alternatives. \"Call once you get there\" is colloquial; \"call upon your arrival\" is more formal and uses \"upon,\" which is a preposition often used in such contexts.\n\nSo, putting these transformations together, the instruction likely requires the friend to convert the input sentences into more formal or standardized versions, possibly using synonym replacements and restructuring phrases into more formal English.\n\nNow, what's a general rule that applies here? It seems like each input is transformed into a more standard or formal version. For example, colloquial expressions are replaced with more formal alternatives, phrasal verbs are broken down, and questions are rephrased using more formal structures.\n\nLet's check each input-output pair again with this hypothesis in mind:\n\n1. Colloquial \"got what you said\" → Formal synonym \"understood you.\" \"Got\" here might be slang for \"understand,\" so replacing with the more formal term.\n\n2. \"Looks like\" is informal, replaced by the synonym \"resembles.\"\n\n3. The question structure is changed. Original is \"Do you want me...\" (contracted form), transformed into \"Shall I accompany you?\" Using \"shall\" makes it more formal, and changing \"go with you\" to \"accompany\" adds formality.\n\n4. \"Whole story was made up\" → \"Entire story was fabricated.\" Both \"whole\" and \"made up\" are colloquial; replacing with \"entire\" and \"fabricated\" (which is more precise and formal for creation of falsehoods).\n\n5. \"Once you get there\" → \"Upon your arrival.\" Colloquial phrase replaced with a more elevated expression using \"upon,\" which is often used in polite requests.\n\nSo the instruction might be to replace informal expressions with their formal equivalents, rephrase sentences into a more polite or standard English, perhaps aiming for a more formal tone. Let's think about how the instruction could be phrased.\n\nPossibly, the instruction was to \"Convert each input sentence into a more formal or polite version\" or \"Rephrase the sentences using synonyms and more formal language.\" Alternatively, it could specify certain transformations, like replacing specific words/phrases with their synonyms or restructuring questions into different forms.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\n- For the first input, \"got\" is replaced with \"understood.\"\n- \"looks like\" becomes \"resembles.\"\n- The question structure is converted from \"do you want...\" to \"shall I...\"\n- \"whole story\" → \"entire story\"\n- \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\"\n\nNotice that some transformations are about synonyms, others are about sentence structure. So the instruction might have two parts: replacing certain words with their formal counterparts and/or rephrasing entire phrases into more formal structures.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to translate the input into a more formal register, possibly emphasizing politeness or formality.\n\nAnother angle: The outputs seem to use more elevated vocabulary. For example, \"entire\" over \"whole,\" \"fabricated\" over \"made up,\" \"accompany\" over \"go with,\" etc. So perhaps the instruction was to use more formal synonyms wherever possible.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to rewrite each sentence into a more polite or formal request. For example, turning questions into \"shall I...\" or using more formal expressions like \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"once you get there.\"\n\nWait, the third input is a question. The output is a declarative statement phrased as a question, using \"shall I...\" which is a formal way to make a suggestion or request.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to convert questions into statements phrased in a polite formal way, using \"shall I accompany you?\" as opposed to the original question.\n\nBut looking at other outputs:\n\nFirst input: changed from a statement to another statement. Second and fourth are also statements. Fifth input is a statement, fifth output is a statement. So maybe not all outputs are questions. Only the third input was a question.\n\nHmm. So maybe the instruction was broader: convert each input into a more formal or polite version, regardless of the input type. But then why does the third input become a question? Wait, no, the third output is a question. Wait, no, wait:\n\nThird input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\" So here, the input is a question (do you want...), but the output is a statement phrased as a question (\"Shall I...\"), which is a polite formal way to ask for permission to do something. So the instruction might involve restructuring questions into polite formal requests using \"shall I...\" or similar constructions.\n\nBut then why isn't the fourth input a question? Because its input is already a statement, so the output is a rephrased statement.\n\nSo maybe the instruction is: Convert each input sentence into a more formal or polite version. For questions, rephrase into a formal request (using \"shall I...\"), and for other sentences, replace informal terms with more formal ones.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to perform a series of transformations: 1) replace informal expressions with their formal synonyms, 2) rephrase sentences into a more polite tone where appropriate, and 3) adjust the sentence structure for formality.\n\nBut let's look for the most general instruction that would cover all these examples. Let's consider that each input was transformed into a more formal or standard version of itself. The key elements are:\n\n- Synonym replacement (e.g., got → understood, made up → fabricated)\n- Phrase replacement (whole → entire)\n- Restructuring questions into formal requests (\"do you want me...\" → \"shall I...\") or into statements (\"do you want me...\" → \"I will accompany you if you need,\" but in the example, it's phrased as a question.)\n\nWait, the output for the third input is a question phrased as a formal request. So maybe the instruction is to take questions and rephrase them into formal polite questions using \"shall I...\" and changing \"do you want me...\" to \"shall I...\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to turn questions into polite formal requests using \"shall I...\" and other forms, while other sentences are converted into their formal counterparts through synonym replacement.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Let's think of possible instructions:\n\n1. \"Rewrite each sentence into a more formal and polite version, replacing informal expressions with their synonyms and adjusting sentence structure as needed.\"\n2. \"Replace informal phrases with their formal equivalents and rephrase the sentences into a more polite tone.\"\n3. \"For each input, produce a more formal and polite version by replacing colloquial terms with synonyms and restructuring the sentence.\"\n4. \"Convert each input into a more formal statement by replacing informal words and phrases with their standard equivalents.\"\n\nLooking at the outputs, the first four examples show word-level replacements (got→understood, looks like→resembles, whole→entire, made up→fabricated). The fifth example shows a phrase replacement (\"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\"). The third example also shows a structural change from a question to a formal request.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to replace informal words/phrases with their formal equivalents and adjust sentence structure to create a more formal tone, especially in questions.\n\nAnother approach: The outputs seem to maintain the same basic meaning but use more formal vocabulary. For example:\n\n\"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\" The core idea is comprehension, but \"understood\" is more formal than \"got.\"\n\n\"She looks like her sister.\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" \"Resembles\" is more formal.\n\n\"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\" Here, the structure changes: from \"do you want me...\" to \"shall I...\" which is a more formal and polite way to ask for permission or offer help.\n\n\"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" \"Entire\" and \"fabricated\" are more formal and precise.\n\n\"Please call once you get there.\" → \"Please call upon your arrival.\" The phrase is replaced with a more elevated expression using \"upon.\"\n\nPutting this all together, the instruction could be something like: \"For each input, rewrite the sentence in a more formal and polite style by replacing informal words and phrases with their formal equivalents and adjusting sentence structure where necessary.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might be more specific. For example:\n\n- Replace instances of \"got\" with \"understood.\"\n- Replace \"looks like\" with \"resembles.\"\n- Convert \"do you want...\" questions into \"shall I...\" requests.\n- Replace \"whole\" with \"entire.\"\n- Replace \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\"\n- Replace \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival.\"\n\nBut since these are individual transformations, the instruction might be more generalized. Another possibility is that the instruction is to translate the inputs into a more formal or standard English, maintaining the same meaning but using more appropriate vocabulary and structure.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible instruction is: \"Translate each sentence into a more formal and standard English version, replacing informal words and phrases with their more precise synonyms and adjusting sentence structure for clarity and formality.\"\n\nAlternatively, since the examples include both word replacements and structural changes, the instruction might require two types of transformations: lexical substitution and syntactic restructuring. However, given the variety of inputs and outputs, the instruction is likely to be broad rather than specific to certain phrases.\n\nTo confirm, if the instruction was \"Rewrite each sentence using more formal language,\" then applying that to each input would produce the outputs listed. Each output does indeed use more formal language compared to the input:\n\n1. \"Understood\" vs. \"got.\"\n2. \"Resembles\" vs. \"looks like.\"\n3. \"Shall I...\" vs. \"Do you want me...\" (structural change and more formal phrasing).\n4. \"Entire\" vs. \"whole,\" \"fabricated\" vs. \"made up.\"\n5. \"Upon your arrival\" vs. \"once you get there.\"\n\nThus, the instruction was probably: \"Convert each input sentence into a more formal and standard version of English.\"\n\nAlternatively, if the instruction was more specific, like \"Replace informal expressions with their formal equivalents and rephrase questions into polite formal requests,\" that would also fit. But given that all outputs are formal, even if the inputs were statements, the most encompassing instruction would be the general one about formality.\n\nTherefore, after considering all possibilities, the instruction was likely to convert the input into a more formal or standard English version, replacing informal terms with synonyms and adjusting structure as necessary.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to the friend was to **convert each input sentence into a more formal and standard version of English**. This involves replacing informal or colloquial expressions with their more precise synonyms and adjusting sentence structures for clarity and formality. Below is the breakdown of how each input was transformed according to this instruction:\n\n1. **Input:** \"I got what you said.\"  \n   **Output:** \"I understood you.\"  \n   *Replacement:* \"Got\" (slang for understanding) → \"understood\" (formal synonym).\n\n2. **Input:** \"She looks like her sister.\"  \n   **Output:** \"She resembles her sister.\"  \n   *Replacement:* \"Looks like\" (colloquial phrase) → \"resembles\" (synonym).\n\n3. **Input:** \"Do you want me to go with you?\"  \n   **Output:** \"Shall I accompany you?\"  \n   *Transformation:* Question phrasing → formal polite request using \"shall I...\"; \"go with you\" → \"accompany\" (more formal).\n\n4. **Input:** \"The whole story was made up.\"  \n   **Output:** \"The entire story was fabricated.\"  \n   *Replacement:* \"Whole\" → \"entire\" (precise synonym); \"made up\" → \"fabricated\" (formal equivalent).\n\n5. **Input:** \"Please call once you get there.\"  \n   **Output:** \"Please call upon your arrival.\"  \n   *Replacement:* \"Once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\" (elevated, formal phrasing).\n\nIn summary, the instruction required rewriting inputs using **formal synonyms**, **adjusting sentence structure**, and **rephrasing** to achieve a more polished and standardized English output. \n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe instruction was to **convert each input sentence into a more formal and standard version of English**, replacing informal expressions with synonyms and restructuring phrases for clarity and politeness.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs where each input was transformed into a new sentence by the friend following the instruction. My job is to deduce the instruction based on these examples.\n\nFirst, I need to look for patterns or common transformations between the inputs and outputs. Let me list them again:\n\n1. Input: Please call once you get there.\n   Output: Please call upon your arrival.\n\n2. Input: I think that this is interesting.\n   Output: It is my opinion that this is interesting.\n\n3. Input: The whole story was made up.\n   Output: The entire story was fabricated.\n\n4. Input: I can't stand his temper.\n   Output: I cannot tolerate his temper.\n\n5. Input: We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\n   Output: It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\n\nHmm, what's the same in all outputs? Let's see each case.\n\nLooking at the first pair: \"call once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival\". The key here might be changing \"once\" to \"upon\" and \"you\" to \"your\". But wait, the input is \"Please call once you get there.\" The output is \"Please call upon your arrival.\" So maybe the instruction is to replace certain phrases or use specific prepositions. But not sure yet.\n\nSecond input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" becomes \"It is my opinion that...\". Here, the output is rephrasing \"I think\" into \"It is my opinion\". Maybe replacing personal opinions with more formal or indirect expressions.\n\nThird input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" So \"whole\" becomes \"entire\", \"made up\" (slang) becomes \"fabricated\". So perhaps replacing informal terms with their standard equivalents. Or maybe generalizing concepts.\n\nFourth input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Again, changing \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\". So maybe replacing idiomatic expressions with synonyms or more formal terms.\n\nFifth input: \"We don't think it's a good idea...\" → \"It is suggested that...\". This seems like a significant change. The original is a negative statement about not doing something, but the output turns it into a positive suggestion. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase negative statements into positive recommendations, perhaps using formal language like \"it is suggested\".\n\nNow, looking across all outputs, I notice some patterns:\n\n- The second output starts with \"It is\", which might suggest turning personal opinions into more formal statements.\n- The third output uses \"entire\" instead of \"whole\", which is more formal.\n- The fourth changes \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\".\n- The fifth transforms a negative statement into a positive suggestion (\"should be done\" vs. \"should not be done\"), but expressed as a suggestion.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input sentences in a more formal, neutral, or professional tone. Let's check each example against that hypothesis.\n\nFirst example: \"Please call once you get there.\" → \"Upon your arrival, please call.\" That does sound more formal. So replacing \"call once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\".\n\nBut why? If the instruction is about formality, maybe it's converting informal phrases to more formal ones, but in this case, \"please call upon your arrival\" is slightly more formal than the original, which already starts with \"please\". Maybe the friend is making the sentence more polite or adjusting the phrasing.\n\nSecond example: \"I think that...\" → \"It is my opinion that...\". Yes, this is a more formal way of expressing an opinion. The output removes the first-person perspective and adds \"my opinion\".\n\nThird example: \"was made up\" → \"was fabricated\". These are synonyms, but \"fabricated\" is more technical. So maybe replacing slang or colloquial terms with more precise vocabulary.\n\nFourth example: \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\". Both mean the same, but \"tolerate\" is less emotionally charged. So replacing colloquial expressions with more neutral or formal ones.\n\nFifth example: Changing a negative statement (\"don't think it's a good idea\") into a positive recommendation (\"no action should be taken\"). This is a big transformation. The original is saying they don't want to do anything, but the output says action shouldn't be taken. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase negative suggestions into positive, more constructive advice.\n\nPutting all this together, possible instructions could be something like:\n\n\"Rephrase each input sentence into a more formal, neutral, or professional tone. Use appropriate terminology and avoid slang or informal expressions.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert negative suggestions into positive ones when possible, or adjust the phrasing for politeness or formality.\n\nWait, but let's check another angle. The outputs vary in structure. For example, the second output is starting with \"It is my opinion...\", while others don't have such a phrase. Maybe the instruction is more about specific transformations rather than a general rephrasing.\n\nLooking back at the fifth input-output pair: \"We don't think it's a good idea...\" becomes \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" This seems like the friend is taking a negative statement and turning it into a positive suggestion. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase negative thoughts into positive, actionable recommendations, especially when they involve not doing something.\n\nBut how do the other examples fit into this? For example, the first example changes \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival\", which is a different structure but not necessarily positive. The second example replaces \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion\". Maybe the instruction is to formalize statements by removing first-person perspectives and making them more objective or professional.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to transform the input into a more formal, indirect manner of speaking, which includes various transformations like replacing contractions with full forms, changing tenses, etc.\n\nLet me check each input-output pair again with this in mind:\n\n1. Original: \"Please call once you get there.\"\n   Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n   Possible transformations: Replace \"once\" with \"upon\", \"you get there\" with \"your arrival\". Both \"once\" and \"upon\" refer to the same time, but \"upon\" is more formal.\n\n2. Original: \"I think that...\"\n   Output: \"It is my opinion...\"\n   So replacing \"I think\" with \"it is my opinion\" which is a more formal way of stating an opinion.\n\n3. Original: \"The whole story was made up.\"\n   Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n   \"Entire\" vs. \"whole\": similar meaning but \"entire\" is more formal. \"Fabricated\" is a synonym but more precise than \"made up\".\n\n4. Original: \"I can't stand his temper.\"\n   Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n   \"Cannot stand\" is replaced with \"cannot tolerate\". Both express dislike, but \"tolerate\" is less emotional.\n\n5. Original: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\"\n   Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n   Here, a negative statement is transformed into a positive recommendation. The original is saying \"we don't think it's a good idea\", which could be seen as suggesting not to act. The output is a more explicit suggestion to take no action. So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase negative opinions into positive, actionable statements, possibly using formal language like \"it is suggested\".\n\nThis seems to align with the fifth example. But how about the other examples? For instance, the fourth example's output is a more neutral statement without suggesting action, whereas the fifth's output does. So maybe the instruction varies based on context?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the overall instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or professional version, which can include various transformations depending on the context. For example, using \"it is suggested\" for certain types of inputs, but also formalizing phrases and replacing contractions.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, many start with \"Please\" or \"It is...\", \"It is suggested...\", \"I cannot...\", \"The entire...\". The outputs seem to have a lot of formal structures. So perhaps the instruction was to rewrite each input into a more formal version, ensuring that the sentences are polite, use appropriate tenses, avoid contractions, etc.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nOriginal 1: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output uses \"please\" but the rest is more formal.\n\nOriginal 2: \"I think...\" → Output uses \"It is my opinion...\" which is a more formal and indirect way of stating the opinion.\n\nOriginal 3: \"The whole story...\" → \"The entire story...\" with \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up\".\n\nOriginal 4: \"I can't stand...\" → \"I cannot tolerate...\" changing \"can't\" to \"cannot\" and \"stand\" to \"tolerate\".\n\nOriginal 5: \"We don't think...\" → \"It is suggested...\" transforming a negative statement into a positive recommendation.\n\nSo the instruction might be to formalize the input by:\n\n- Using more formal or polite language (like replacing \"please\" with \"please\" but perhaps more explicit).\n- Rewriting personal opinions into more indirect or formal statements.\n- Replacing informal or colloquial expressions with more standard vocabulary.\n- Converting negative statements into positive, actionable recommendations when applicable.\n\nBut how to distill this into a single instruction? The key might be that the friend was instructed to rephrase the inputs in a more formal, neutral, or professional tone, using appropriate grammar, avoiding contractions, and sometimes restructuring the sentence to make it more indirect or objective.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the fifth example, the instruction might have been to convert any suggestion of not doing something into a recommendation to take no action, framed positively. But other examples don't fit that pattern.\n\nAnother possibility is that the friend was asked to translate the input into a more formal version, which includes various transformations like replacing words with their synonyms (e.g., \"made up\" → \"fabricated\"), adjusting verb forms (e.g., present continuous to past), and changing sentence structures (e.g., passive voice in the third example).\n\nLooking at the third input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" So \"whole\" to \"entire\" (same meaning but more formal), \"made up\" (slang) to \"fabricated\" (formal). This suggests replacing informal expressions with their formal counterparts.\n\nSimilarly, the first example: \"Please call once you get there.\" → \"Please call upon your arrival.\" Here, \"once\" becomes \"upon\", and \"you get there\" becomes \"your arrival\". So perhaps replacing \"once\" with \"upon\" and changing \"you get there\" to \"your arrival\".\n\nThe second example: \"I think...\" → \"It is my opinion...\". So removing the subject (\"I\") and using a more formal phrase.\n\nFourth example: \"I can't stand...\" → \"I cannot tolerate...\". Again, changing \"can't\" to \"cannot\" and \"stand\" to \"tolerate\".\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to replace informal expressions with their more formal equivalents. Let's check:\n\n- \"Once you get there\" → \"Upon your arrival\" – both mean the same, but \"upon\" is more formal.\n- \"made up\" → \"fabricated\" – replacing slang with technical term.\n- \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" – changing to formal verb.\n- \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion\" – more indirect and formal.\n\nIn the fifth example, it's more about rephrasing a negative statement into a positive suggestion. So maybe the instruction is to take any statement and turn it into a positive, professional recommendation, especially when the original is a negative suggestion.\n\nBut the fifth example's output doesn't fit that pattern exactly because the original wasn't a direct suggestion but a statement of opinion. However, the output is a suggestion. So maybe the instruction is broader: whenever possible, rephrase negative or uncertain statements into positive, actionable recommendations using formal language.\n\nPutting all this together, the most likely instruction is: \"Rephrase each input sentence into a more formal, professional tone. Use appropriate grammar and avoid contractions. Where possible, convert negative statements into positive, actionable recommendations.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be more specific. For example, the friend was told to replace certain phrases like \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion,\" replace \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate,\" \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival,\" replace informal terms with more formal ones, and turn negative suggestions into positive recommendations.\n\nBut since the examples cover various transformations, it's possible that the instruction was a combination of multiple tasks. However, the user is asking for the original instruction, so we need to formulate a single instruction that encompasses all the observed transformations.\n\nAnother angle: all outputs start with \"Please\" or \"It is...\". Let's see:\n\n- First output starts with \"Please\" (same as input).\n- Second starts with \"It is\".\n- Third starts with \"The entire\".\n- Fourth starts with \"I cannot\".\n- Fifth starts with \"It is suggested\".\n\nSo the outputs vary in sentence starters. But the common thread might be that the instruction requires making the sentences more formal or indirect. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to use a particular phrase structure, like starting with \"It is my opinion\" for personal beliefs or \"We suggest\" for recommendations.\n\nWait, the second example's output is \"It is my opinion...\". The third example's output is \"The entire story was fabricated.\" (no starter phrase). The fourth is \"I cannot...\" The fifth is \"It is suggested...\".\n\nThis inconsistency makes it tricky. Perhaps the instruction was more general: \"Rephrase each input into a formal, neutral statement, adjusting vocabulary and grammar as needed.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the friend was supposed to translate each input into a more formal version by using appropriate language structures and terms, which could include various transformations as seen in the examples.\n\nGiven that all examples show changes in phrasing or vocabulary, the most encompassing instruction would be to rephrase each input into a more formal, objective, and polite version, adjusting grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure accordingly. This would cover replacing informal expressions with more formal ones, rephrasing opinions into more indirect statements, using appropriate tenses, and ensuring clarity.\n\nTherefore, the original instruction was likely: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal, professional version of the sentence. Use proper grammar and avoid contractions. Adjust the wording to be more indirect or objective where appropriate.\"\n\nThis instruction accounts for the various transformations observed, from changing \"I think\" to \"it is my opinion,\" adjusting phrases like \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate,\" replacing \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival,\" and turning negative statements into positive recommendations using formal language like \"it is suggested.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe original instruction was: **\"Rewrite each input into a more formal, professional version of the sentence. Use proper grammar and avoid contractions. Adjust the wording to be more indirect or objective where appropriate.\"**\n\n**Key Transformations Explained:**\n1. **Formal Phrasing:** Replace informal expressions (e.g., \"call once you get there\") with more formal alternatives (e.g., \"call upon your arrival\").\n2. **Objectivity:** Convert first-person opinions (e.g., \"I think that...\") into neutral statements (e.g., \"It is my opinion...\").\n3. **Precision:** Substitute slang or colloquial terms (e.g., \"made up\") with more technical or precise synonyms (e.g., \"fabricated\").\n4. **Tone Adjustment:** Change emotionally charged phrases (e.g., \"can't stand\") to more neutral or indirect ones (e.g., \"cannot tolerate\").\n5. **Positive Recommendations:** Reframe negative suggestions into positive, actionable advice (e.g., turning \"don’t think it’s a good idea\" into \"no action should be taken\"). \n\nThese steps collectively ensure outputs are polite, clear, and aligned with professional communication standards.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

So, each input is a sentence, and the output is another sentence. I need to see if there's a common pattern or transformation applied to each input to get the output. Let me go through each pair one by one.\n\nFirst, the first input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Hmm, so here, they added \"whom\" before \"I\". Wait, but in the original input, the subject after the verb is \"I met yesterday\", which is a relative clause. So maybe the instruction was to add a relative pronoun when a certain condition is met? Like, when the antecedent is a proper noun, use \"whom\"? But wait, \"lawyer\" is a common noun. Wait, no. Wait, the original sentence uses \"was helpful\"—the structure is \"The lawyer [that/who] I met yesterday...\" So perhaps the instruction was to replace \"I met\" with \"whom I met\" in such cases. But why only here and not in other examples?\n\nLet me check the second example: Input is \"Please call once you get there.\" Output is \"Please call upon your arrival.\" Here, the preposition \"once\" was replaced with \"upon\", and \"you get there\" became \"your arrival\". That seems like rephrasing a common phrase. \"Once you get there\" is similar to \"Upon your arrival\". So maybe the instruction was to replace certain phrases with more formal alternatives? But not all examples are replacing phrases. The third input is \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" So here, the verb \"got\" was replaced with \"understood\", and \"what you said\" became \"you\". Not sure about the exact replacement rule here.\n\nFourth input: \"This song is fire.\" Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\" So \"fire\" is slang meaning excellent, and the output uses a longer expression. So maybe replacing informal slang with more formal expressions. Fifth input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" So \"can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish\". So here, the entire phrase is being rephrased into a different structure.\n\nWait, looking at all these outputs, there's a mix of different transformations. Some are about replacing specific phrases (like \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"once you get there\"), others are about rephrasing entire clauses (like changing \"can't tell the difference\" to \"find it hard to distinguish\"), and some involve adding specific words like \"whom\" (in the first case). But how to connect these into a single instruction?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal or literary style. For example, replacing contractions, informal expressions, and using more elaborate phrasing. Let's see:\n\n- First example: Adding \"whom\" makes it more formal. Using \"whom\" instead of \"who\" in cases where the antecedent is a proper noun? Wait, \"lawyer\" is a common noun, but maybe the instruction was about using \"whom\" when referring to a person? Wait, but in the original sentence, \"I met the lawyer yesterday\" could be rewritten as \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday\", which is grammatically correct but more formal. So maybe the instruction was to insert \"whom\" in relative clauses referring to people.\n\nSecond example: Changing \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival\" seems like replacing a colloquial expression with a more formal one. Similarly, \"Please call once you get there\" is a request to call upon arriving, which is a bit old-fashioned. So maybe replacing certain temporal expressions with their formal equivalents.\n\nThird example: \"I got what you said\" is a casual way of saying \"I understood you\". So replacing \"got\" (a colloquial verb meaning 'understand') with \"understood\", and shortening \"what you said\" to \"you\".\n\nFourth example: \"is fire\" (slang for 'very good') replaced with \"is incredibly good\". So replacing informal slang with more standard adjectives.\n\nFifth example: \"can't tell the difference between these two\" rephrased as \"find it hard to distinguish between them\". So changing the entire phrase from a negative capability (\"can't\") to a neutral statement (\"find it hard to\").\n\nSo putting this together, the instruction might have been to rewrite each input into a more formal or literary style by making several transformations: replacing informal expressions with their formal counterparts, expanding abbreviations or contractions, using more elaborate language structures (like inserting \"whom\" in appropriate places), and replacing slang terms with standard vocabulary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each transformation is a rule-based rewrite. For example:\n\n1. When a relative clause refers to a person (proper noun or not), add \"whom\" before the subject pronoun.\n2. Replace \"once you\" with \"upon your\" when followed by a past participle or a present participle.\n3. Convert contractions like \"got what\" to \"understood you\".\n4. Replace informal adjectives like \"fire\" with more descriptive terms.\n5. Replace idiomatic phrases like \"can't tell the difference\" with more neutral \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n\nBut how does that fit into a single instruction? Maybe the instruction was to apply a set of stylistic changes to make the sentences more formal and literary, using a mix of such transformations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to translate each input into a more polite or indirect form. For example:\n\n1. Add \"whom\" to refer to people in relative clauses (as in the first example).\n2. Use \"upon\" instead of \"once\" in certain contexts (second example).\n3. Replace \"got\" with \"understood\" to make it more direct (third example).\n4. Replace slang \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\" (fourth example).\n5. Replace \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish\" for politeness (fifth example).\n\nIf that's the case, then the instruction could be something like: \"Make the following stylistic and linguistic adjustments to each input: replace contractions with full forms, update colloquial phrases to formal equivalents, add relative pronouns where appropriate, modify slang expressions to more standard terms, and rephrase certain phrases for clarity or formality.\"\n\nBut the key is to find a concise instruction that encompasses all these changes. Alternatively, maybe each transformation has its own rule, but grouped under a common umbrella of \"refining and formalizing the language\".\n\nAnother angle: Looking at all the outputs, there's a tendency towards making the sentences more formal, less colloquial, and using more complex structures. So the instruction might have been to \"convert each sentence into a more formal and literary style by adjusting word choices, phrasing, and grammatical structures as needed.\"\n\nAlternatively, considering the examples:\n\n- In the first case, \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\", suggesting adding \"whom\" in relative clauses.\n- The second example uses \"upon your arrival\" for \"once you get there\", which is a formalization.\n- Third: replacing \"got\" with \"understood\".\n- Fourth: replacing slang \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\".\n- Fifth: replacing \"can't tell\" with \"find it hard to\".\n\nSo combining all these, the instruction could be: \"Replace informal contractions with their expanded forms; adjust phrases like 'once you' to 'upon your', replace slang terms with more descriptive adjectives; rephrase common phrases like 'can't tell the difference' into 'find it hard to distinguish'; and in relative clauses referring to people, use 'whom' instead of 'who' or 'that'.\"\n\nBut to make it a coherent instruction, perhaps grouping these transformations under a common purpose, such as \"polishing the text to a more formal register\" or \"improving the writing style by refining language choices.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was specifically to add the word \"whom\" in certain relative clauses, replace \"once you\" with \"upon your\", convert \"got what\" to \"understood\", replace \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\", and replace \"can't tell\" with \"find it hard to\". But that would be very specific. However, looking at the fifth example, \"I can't tell the difference\" becomes \"I find it hard to distinguish between them\". The difference here is not just replacing \"can't\" with \"find it hard to\", but also expanding \"difference\" into \"distinguish between...\". So the transformation might be more than just replacing the phrase.\n\nSo putting all these together, the instruction likely involved multiple steps or rules to transform each input into the output by formalizing language, replacing colloquialisms, adjusting relative clauses, and rephrasing certain phrases for clarity and formality.\n\nTherefore, the instruction given was probably something like: \"Refine each sentence by replacing informal contractions, updating phrases like 'once you get there' to 'upon your arrival', using 'whom' in relative clauses referring to people, converting slang terms to standard adjectives, and rephrasing idiomatic expressions into more neutral language.\"\n\nBut to ensure accuracy, I should check if all outputs strictly follow a single rule or if there are multiple rules. For instance:\n\n- The first example fits the addition of \"whom\".\n- The second example fits replacing \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\".\n- The third example fits replacing \"got what\" with \"understood you\".\n- The fourth example replaces slang \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\".\n- The fifth example replaces \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n\nEach of these seems to be a distinct transformation, possibly grouped under the instruction to \"polish the language by improving clarity, formality, and style\". However, the fact that each input-output pair follows different rules suggests that the instruction may have been a combination of specific linguistic tasks rather than a single rule. But perhaps there's a overarching theme that unites all these changes: making the sentences more formal and refined.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the inputs into a more literary or academic style by modifying grammar, vocabulary, and phrasing as needed. In that case, the instruction could be concise: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal and elegant style, adjusting grammar, vocabulary, and structure as necessary.\"\n\nHowever, considering that each example required a different adjustment, it's possible that the instruction included multiple specific rules. For example:\n\n1. Add \"whom\" in relative clauses where the antecedent is a person.\n2. Replace \"once you\" with \"upon your arrival\" in similar constructions.\n3. Replace \"got what\" with \"understood you\".\n4. Replace \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\".\n5. Replace \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish between them\".\n\nBut the problem states that the friend received an instruction and five inputs, and the friend applied the instruction to each input to produce the outputs. Therefore, the instruction must cover all these cases. However, unless there's a common thread, it's challenging to pinpoint a single instruction.\n\nAnother approach: look for a pattern in the verbs used in the instructions. For instance, \"refined,\" \"improved,\" \"polished,\" \"updated,\" etc., but the exact wording would depend on the instruction. Alternatively, think about the transformation steps the friend took:\n\n- Changed \"met\" to \"met\" (wait, no, the first example added \"whom\"). So maybe the instruction was to add \"whom\" in relative clauses.\n- Updated \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival\".\n- Replaced \"got\" with \"understood\".\n- Slang \"fire\" to \"incredibly good\".\n- Rewrote \"can't tell\" as \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n\nSo, possible instruction: \"For each input, perform the following transformations: add 'whom' in relative clauses referring to people, replace 'once you' with 'upon your arrival', convert 'got' to 'understood', replace slang 'fire' with 'incredibly good', and rephrase 'can't tell the difference' as 'find it hard to distinguish between'.\" But that's five separate steps, which might not be captured in a single instruction.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction was more general: \"Apply stylistic improvements by updating contractions, adjusting phrasing for clarity, and enhancing vocabulary where possible.\"\n\nGiven that all the outputs are stylistic refinements, the most encompassing instruction would be one that asks for improving the writing style by making such adjustments. However, the exact wording needs to be inferred from the examples.\n\nAlternatively, considering the outputs, the instruction might have been to \"convert each sentence into a more formal and literate version by replacing contractions, modifying temporal expressions, refining relative clauses, and replacing informal terms with more precise vocabulary.\"\n\nBut since all the examples show different types of transformations, the instruction likely involves multiple specific steps or a combination of them. However, the key is to determine the common thread that binds all these changes.\n\nAnother angle: All the outputs are longer than their inputs. Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 9 words, output: 11 words.\nSecond input: 6 words, output: 7 words.\nThird input: 5 words, output: 5 words. Wait, third input is \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" So input had \"got what you said\" (4 words?), output is \"understood you\" (3 words). So actually, the output is shorter. Hmm. So the length isn't necessarily increasing.\n\nFourth input: input \"This song is fire.\" Output \"This song is incredibly good.\" So longer.\nFifth input: input \"I can't tell the difference...\" Output \"I find it hard to distinguish...\" Longer.\n\nSo some outputs are longer, some shorter. But the main point is the transformation in style.\n\nAnother observation: The first example adds \"whom\", which is a relative pronoun. So maybe the instruction was to insert \"whom\" in relative clauses where the antecedent is a person. The second example changes \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival\", which is a more formal phrasing. Third example replaces \"got what\" with \"understood\". Fourth: slang to more descriptive adjective. Fifth: rephrase \"can't tell the difference\" into \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n\nPutting this together, the instruction might have been: \"For each input, apply the following transformations:\n\n1. In relative clauses where the antecedent is a person (e.g., 'The lawyer I met'), add 'whom' immediately before the subject pronoun (e.g., 'The lawyer whom I met yesterday').\n\n2. Replace instances of 'once you [verb]' with 'upon your [verb]'.\n\n3. Convert contractions like 'got what' to their expanded forms ('understood you').\n\n4. Replace slang terms like 'fire' with more descriptive adjectives (e.g., 'incredibly good').\n\n5. Rewrite idiomatic phrases like 'can't tell the difference' as 'find it hard to distinguish [between]' to improve clarity and formality.\"\n\nHowever, the instruction needs to be concise enough that the friend could follow it without ambiguity. If the instruction was presented as a list of tasks to perform on each input, that would work. But the user mentioned that the friend received a single instruction, not a list of steps. So perhaps the instruction was phrased in a way that encapsulates all these possible transformations, such as: \"Adjust each sentence to enhance its formality and clarity by making the following changes where applicable: replace contractions, update temporal phrases, refine relative clauses, replace slang with more precise vocabulary, and rephrase idiomatic expressions for greater precision.\"\n\nAlternatively, if the instruction was to \"polish each sentence by making it more formal and clear through various linguistic adjustments,\" then that would cover all the examples, even though each example required a specific adjustment. However, this is quite abstract.\n\nAnother thought: Perhaps the instruction was to translate the input into a more polite or indirect form. For example, \"Instead of using contractions or direct statements, rephrase the sentences in a more polite or formal manner, adjusting grammar, vocabulary, and phrasing accordingly.\" But again, this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been: \"For each input, rephrase it using a more formal register by replacing informal expressions, adjusting relative clauses, and modifying phrasing for clarity.\"\n\nGiven that the outputs require varying types of changes, but all fall under style refinement, the most likely instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal and elegant style, adjusting grammar, vocabulary, and phrasing as needed. However, to match the examples exactly, maybe the instruction included specific steps, but the user expects the answer to deduce the instruction based on the patterns observed.\n\nIn conclusion, the instruction was to transform each input into a more formal and refined version by:\n\n- Adding \"whom\" in appropriate relative clauses.\n- Updating certain phrases (e.g., \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival\").\n- Converting slang or colloquial expressions into more descriptive vocabulary.\n- Rephrasing idiomatic expressions into more neutral or precise terms.\n- Possibly adjusting other elements like verb tenses or pronoun usage where applicable.\n\nThe exact instruction would likely be a set of such refinements grouped under the aim of improving the writing style.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to the friend was to **polish each sentence into a more formal and stylistically refined version** through the following systematic transformations:\n\n1. **Relative Clauses**: Insert \"whom\" in relative clauses where the antecedent refers to a person (e.g., \"The lawyer I met yesterday\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday\").\n2. **Temporal Phrases**: Replace \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\" to formalize expressions (e.g., \"Please call once you get there\" → \"Please call upon your arrival\").\n3. **Contractions/Vocabulary**: Expand contractions (e.g., \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\") and replace slang/colloquialisms with more precise terms (e.g., \"This song is fire\" → \"This song is incredibly good\").\n4. **Idiomatic Adjustments**: Rephrase idioms into clearer alternatives (e.g., \"I can't tell the difference\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish\").\n\nThe overarching goal was to enhance clarity, formality, and elegance by addressing grammar, vocabulary, and phrasing as needed. Each output exemplifies these adjustments tailored to the input’s context. \n\n**Final Instruction**:  \n\"Refine each input by enhancing its formality and clarity through strategic additions of 'whom,' formalizing temporal phrases, expanding contractions, replacing slang with descriptive terms, and rephrasing idioms for precision.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs, and we need to reverse-engineer the instruction from them. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me list out the examples again to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nInput 1: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\nInput 2: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\nInput 3: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\nInput 4: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\"\nInput 5: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n\nLooking at these outputs, they seem to be rephrasing the original inputs but with some specific transformations. Let's break each down.\n\nStarting with Input 1: The original is a casual greeting. The output changes the perspective from second person (\"you\") to first person (\"I look forward\"), adds \"to meeting,\" which is more formal. So maybe the instruction is about transforming statements into more formal or polite responses?\n\nInput 2: Original uses \"I think\" and the output replaces it with \"It is my opinion...\" That might be part of making the statement more formal or objective. So perhaps the instruction is about converting statements into more formal or impersonal expressions.\n\nInput 3: Original is negative (\"don't think it's a good idea\") and the output turns it into a positive suggestion (\"It is suggested that no action...\"). The output seems to rephrase the negative into a positive recommendation. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase negative suggestions into positive recommendations.\n\nInput 4: \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you.\" This is a simplification, removing the first-person \"I got\" and changing \"you said\" to just \"you.\" So perhaps the instruction involves shortening or simplifying the response, or converting reported speech to direct expression.\n\nInput 5: Directly substituting \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate.\" This is a synonym replacement. The instruction might involve replacing certain phrases with synonyms or more formal equivalents.\n\nNow, trying to see commonalities across all these transformations. Let's categorize possible patterns:\n\n1. **Formalization**: Inputs are informal, outputs are more formal (Inputs 1,2).\n2. **Rephrasing Negative to Positive**: Input 3's output turns a negative into a positive suggestion.\n3. **Simplification/Condensation**: Input 4 reduces the sentence length and phrasing.\n4. **Synonym Replacement**: Input 5 replaces a phrase with a synonym.\n\nBut the instruction probably combines multiple patterns. Let's see if there's a central theme.\n\nAnother angle: The outputs often start with \"I\" or \"It is\" structures. For example, Input 1 becomes a first-person statement, Input 2 uses \"It is my opinion,\" Input 3 uses \"It is suggested,\" etc. Maybe the instruction is to rewrite the input into a first-person statement, using appropriate connectors like \"I look forward,\" \"I think,\" \"It is recommended,\" etc.\n\nWait, but Input 3's output uses \"It is suggested,\" which might fit a more professional or bureaucratic tone. Let's check that. Input 1's output uses \"look forward to,\" which could be seen as more polite. So maybe the instruction is to convert the input into a more formal or polite response, adjusting the subject and phrasing accordingly.\n\nLooking at Input 3 again: \"We don't think...\" becomes \"It is suggested...\" That's a change in perspective from a group (\"We\") to a third party giving a suggestion. So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a formal, third-person perspective, using certain connectives like \"It is recommended,\" \"It is suggested,\" etc., depending on the situation.\n\nSimilarly, Input 2 uses \"It is my opinion,\" which shifts the perspective from first to third person, which might align with formal writing where personal opinions are presented as such.\n\nIn Input 4, the output removes the subject \"you,\" so \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you.\" Maybe the instruction is to remove the addressee (like \"you\" or \"your\") to make it more general or eliminate direct address.\n\nInput 5 is straightforward synonym replacement. So perhaps the instruction involves replacing certain expressions with more formal or different ones.\n\nPutting this together, possible instruction: \"Rewrite the given statement into a formal or polite response, adjusting the subject and phrasing. Use appropriate connectives like 'I look forward,' 'It is suggested,' 'It is my opinion,' or others as needed. Also, eliminate direct addresses (replace 'you' with general terms) where applicable.\"\n\nBut let's test this hypothesis against the examples.\n\nInput 1: Original is informal, rewritten to a more polite form starting with \"I look forward to...\" which fits.\n\nInput 2: Original uses \"I think,\" rewritten to a more formal \"It is my opinion,\" which works.\n\nInput 3: Original is a negative suggestion (\"don't think it's a good idea\"), rewritten to a positive suggestion in third person (\"no action should be taken\"), which fits the instruction of making it a suggestion (possibly from a higher authority or in a report).\n\nInput 4: Rewrote \"I got what you said\" to \"I understood you,\" eliminating the \"you\" and rephrasing \"got\" to \"understood.\"\n\nInput 5: Synonym replacement \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate.\"\n\nSo the instruction likely requires the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite version, possibly starting with \"I\" or \"It is,\" avoiding direct addresses, and replacing certain expressions with synonyms.\n\nTherefore, the instruction could be: \"Convert the given statement into a formal or polite response by rephrasing it into the first or third person, adjusting vocabulary and structure as needed. Avoid direct addresses (replace 'you' with more general terms) and use appropriate connectives (e.g., 'I look forward,' 'It is suggested,' etc.).\"\n\nAlternatively, another possible instruction could be \"Rewrite each input into a more formal statement, replacing informal expressions with their formal equivalents and restructuring sentences to avoid direct addresses.\"\n\nEither way, the key elements are formalization, restructuring, and eliminating direct addresses.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to your friend was to **rephrase each input into a formal or polite response**. This involved:\n\n1. **Formalizing Language**: Converting informal or casual statements into more formal or professional phrasing. For example:\n   - \"See you tonight\" → \"I look forward to meeting you.\"\n   - \"I think that...\" → \"It is my opinion that...\"\n\n2. **Eliminating Direct Addresses**: Removing \"you\" or \"your\" to generalize the response. Examples:\n   - \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you.\"\n   - \"I can't stand his temper\" → \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n\n3. **Structural Adjustments**: Restructuring sentences for clarity and politeness:\n   - Turning negatives into positive suggestions: \"We don't think...\" → \"no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n\n4. **Synonym Replacement**: Replacing colloquial phrases with synonyms or more formal terms.\n\n**Final Instruction**:  \n\"Rewrite each input into a formal, polite response by adjusting vocabulary, phrasing, and structure to avoid direct addresses (e.g., replace 'you' with 'one' or eliminate entirely) and formalize the language using appropriate connectors like 'I look forward,' 'It is suggested,' or 'My opinion is.'\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

Hmm, the friend converted each input into the output as shown. So I need to reverse-engineer the rule or pattern that connects each input to its corresponding output. Let's go through each example step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first pair: Input \"I considered many approaches.\" became \"Various approaches were considered.\" What's the transformation here? The subject changed from \"I\" to \"Various\", and the verb phrase \"considered\" moved to the end as an adjective phrase. Also, \"many approaches\" became \"various approaches\". Wait, maybe it's a rephrasing that changes the perspective or uses more formal language? Like replacing \"I\" with \"one\" or \"someone\", but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's changing from first person to third person in a general sense. For example, \"Many people consider various approaches.\" But the output is singular. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's converting the sentence into a passive voice or a different structure. Let's check the next example.\n\nSecond input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" Here, the question structure changes. The original starts with \"Can you...\", which is a yes/no question. The output uses \"Would you be able...\" which is more of a polite request. So perhaps the instruction is to convert questions into statements using more formal or polite phrasing. Let's see another example.\n\nThird input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\". So changing the pronoun from \"I\" to \"whom\", but why \"whom\"? Maybe the instruction is to use more formal pronouns like \"one\" or \"he/she\" instead of personal pronouns. Wait, but \"whom\" is part of a relative clause. So perhaps the rule is to replace possessive pronouns with possessive \"whom\"? That might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to change the possessive \"my\" to \"one's\", but the original input has \"I met\", which is \"I\" as the subject. The output uses \"whom\" in the relative clause, replacing the object form. Wait, in the original input, the clause is \"I met yesterday\", and in the output, it's \"whom I met yesterday\". So the possessive \"I\" in the main clause becomes \"whom\" in the relative clause. Interesting. So maybe the instruction is to turn \"I\" into \"whom\" in certain contexts, but only when the subject is the one being referred to in the relative clause. Not sure yet.\n\nFourth input: \"See you tonight.\" Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" So here, the input is an informal greeting or saying goodbye, and the output is a more formal statement expressing anticipation. So maybe the instruction is to respond formally when receiving a message like \"see you\" by offering to look forward to the meeting.\n\nFifth input: \"This song is fire.\" Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\" Here, the colloquial expression \"fire\" is replaced with \"incredibly good\". So perhaps the instruction is to translate informal slang into more standard expressions.\n\nPutting all these transformations together, trying to find a common thread. Let's list each transformation again:\n\n1. I considered... → Various approaches were considered.\n   - Changed first person to third person (plural?), maybe made more general.\n2. Can you... → Would you be able...\n   - Changed a question to a more polite request, possibly with past tense implication (could → would).\n3. The lawyer I met yesterday... → The lawyer whom I met yesterday...\n   - Replaced \"I met\" with \"whom I met\" in the relative clause.\n4. See you tonight. → I look forward to meeting you...\n   - Converted informal farewell into a formal statement of anticipation.\n5. This song is fire. → This song is incredibly good.\n   - Slang to more formal adjectives.\n\nWait, maybe the instruction is about transforming informal, less formal sentences into more formal ones. Let's check each example:\n\nFor the first input, \"I considered many approaches\" to \"Various approaches were considered.\" — This seems to take the personal reference away (\"I\" to \"various\"), and the verb phrase shifts to a passive-like structure (\"were considered\"). But \"various\" isn't passive. Alternatively, maybe it's changing from active to passive voice? Original is active (\"I considered\"), output is \"Various were considered\" but without \"by someone\". Not exactly passive. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence into a more general or impersonal tone.\n\nSecond input: Question to polite request. So changing \"can you\" to \"would you be able\". That makes the request more indirect and polite.\n\nThird input: Changing possessive pronoun \"I\" to \"whom\" in the relative clause. So replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met\". That's a grammatical transformation, but why \"whom\"? Maybe in formal writing, they use more objective case pronouns for emphasis, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to replace \"my\" with \"his\" or \"her\" in certain contexts, but in this example, it's \"I met\" becoming \"whom I met\". So perhaps the rule is to replace possessive \"my\" with \"his\" when referring to a male, etc., but here the input uses \"I\", so the output uses \"whom\".\n\nFourth input: \"See you\" transformed into \"look forward to meeting\". So replacing the informal expression with a formal intention.\n\nFifth input: \"fire\" slang replaced with \"incredibly good\".\n\nSo combining all these, the instruction could be something like: \"Rewrite the input sentences in a more formal, professional tone by making necessary adjustments to grammar, vocabulary, and phrasing.\"\n\nBut wait, let's check if that applies to all examples. The third example uses \"whom\", which is part of a formal structure. The fourth example uses \"look forward to\", which is formal. The fifth example replaces slang with a more formal adjective. However, the first example changes \"I\" to \"various approaches were considered\". But how does \"various approaches were considered\" feel more formal? It's possible that the original is a bit too casual, so the output makes it more general and passive. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to replace \"I\" with \"one\" or \"people\" in certain contexts, but in this example, it's singular \"various\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase each sentence into a more formal equivalent by adjusting the subject, verb, or overall structure. For example:\n\n- Replace first-person pronouns with third-person or collective nouns.\n- Convert questions into statements using more polite phrasing.\n- Use more formal pronouns like \"they\" or \"it\" where applicable.\n- Convert informal greetings into formal expressions of anticipation.\n- Replace colloquialisms with more standard adjectives.\n\nBut why \"whom\" in the third example? If the instruction is to use more formal pronouns, maybe replacing \"I\" with \"we\" or \"me\" with \"us\", but in this case, it's \"whom\". Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to use more formal relative clauses by replacing possessive \"my\" with \"whose\", but here it's \"I met\" vs \"whom I met\". So maybe the rule is to change the possessive from \"my\" to \"his/her/their\" when referring to a person, but in this example, \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\". Hmm, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to make the sentence more impersonal by removing the subject \"I\" and restructuring the sentence. For example, the first input becomes \"Various approaches were considered\" (removing \"I\") and restructuring. The third input becomes \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday...\" which still has \"I met\", but \"whom\" is used here. Wait, maybe the rule is that whenever there's a possessive \"my\" followed by a verb phrase, replace it with \"whom\". But in the third example, the input is \"I met\", not \"my met\". So maybe that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the third example's output, \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Could this be a case of the instruction to use the object pronoun \"whom\" in a relative clause where it's typically used? For instance, in formal writing, one might prefer \"whom\" over \"who\" in certain cases. So maybe the instruction is to use \"whom\" in such relative clauses when the subject is the same as the antecedent. Wait, in this case, \"The lawyer whom I met\" – the antecedent is \"lawyer\", so \"whom\" is correct. But the original is \"I met\", not \"the lawyer I met\". So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the clause to include the relative pronoun correctly. For example, changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" to match the relative clause structure. But why \"whom\" instead of \"who\"?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to replace \"met\" with \"met with\" in formal contexts, but that doesn't fit here. Or perhaps it's about proper use of pronouns in complex sentences.\n\nLet me consider the third example again. Original: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the main difference is the use of \"whom\" instead of \"I\" in the relative clause. So the instruction could be: \"Replace 'I' with 'whom' in relative clauses to adhere to formal pronoun usage.\" But why would \"whom\" be more formal than \"I\" here? In informal speech, people often use \"I\" even in relative clauses, but in formal writing, \"whom\" is preferred. For example, \"The man I met yesterday\" vs \"The man whom I met yesterday\". So maybe the instruction is to adjust pronouns to follow formal grammar rules.\n\nIf that's the case, then other examples could also fit. For example, in the second example, changing \"you\" to \"your\" or \"one\". But the second example's output is \"Would you be able...\", which is a different structure. So perhaps the instruction is a combination of multiple rules: adjust pronouns, rephrase questions into polite requests, replace slang, etc.\n\nLooking back at the first example: \"I considered many approaches.\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" Here, \"I\" is replaced with \"various\", but maybe that's part of making the sentence more general. So \"various\" implies that it's a general case rather than a specific instance involving \"I\". So perhaps the instruction is to make the subject more general or remove the personal pronoun by replacing it with a noun like \"various\", \"many\", etc. That could explain the first example. Then the third example uses \"whom\" to adjust the pronoun in the relative clause.\n\nAnother thought: the first example's output is similar to turning it into a passive voice. \"I considered\" → \"Various approaches were considered\". But passive voice usually changes the subject to the object, which is what happens here (\"I\" becomes \"various\"). But passive voice would require a verb form ending in \"ed\", like \"was considered\". The original is active. So maybe the instruction is not just passive voice, but changing from active to passive while also making the subject more generic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the entire sentence into a more formal, perhaps more academic or professional style, which requires adjusting pronouns, changing question structures, using more formal adjectives, and restructuring sentences to be more general or impersonal.\n\nSo combining all these observations, the instruction might be along the lines of: \"Rearrange each input into a more formal and professional tone by adjusting grammar, vocabulary, and phrasing to avoid first-person references, transform questions into polite statements, use formal pronouns in relative clauses, replace informal expressions with more standard alternatives, and restructure sentences for clarity and formality.\"\n\nTesting this hypothesis against the examples:\n\n1. \"I considered...\" → more formal → \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n2. \"Can you...\" → polite request → \"Would you be able...\"\n3. \"I met\" → relative clause with formal \"whom\"\n4. \"See you...\" → formal anticipation → \"I look forward...\"\n5. \"This song is fire\" → standard adjective → \"incredibly good\"\n\nYes, that seems to fit. So the instruction likely involves multiple aspects of formality and restructuring, leading to the outputs provided.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided was to **reformat each input into a more formal and professional tone** by applying the following transformations:\n\n1. **Avoid First-Person Pronouns**: Remove \"I\" or rephrase sentences to use collective/nouns (e.g., \"various approaches\" instead of \"I considered\").\n2. **Convert Questions into Polite Requests**: Turn \"Can you...\" into \"Would you be able...\" for indirectness and politeness.\n3. **Formalize Relative Clauses**: Replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in relative clauses to adhere to formal grammar rules (e.g., \"whom I met\" vs. \"I met\").\n4. **Replace Informal Phrases**: Change casual greetings (\"See you\") to formal expressions (\"look forward to meeting\").\n5. **Standardize Slang/Acronyms**: Translate informal expressions like \"fire\" into conventional adjectives (e.g., \"incredibly good\").\n\nBy systematically applying these rules, each input was transformed into a clearer, more formal response. \n\n**Final Answer**:  \nThe instruction was to rephrase each input into a **more formal and professional tone**, adjusting pronouns, rephrasing questions, refining relative clauses, substituting informal expressions, and standardizing slang for clarity.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs, so I need to analyze each pair to see if there's a common pattern or transformation applied to each input to get the corresponding output. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with the first input-output pair:\nInput: The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.  \nOutput: The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.  \nHmm, here the output changes \"I\" to \"whom\". So, maybe the instruction is about converting possessive pronouns into their object forms? But wait, in the original sentence, \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\". The \"I\" in \"I met\" is the subject, but when they say \"whom\", it's because of the verb \"met\" (past tense of meet), which takes the object form. So perhaps the instruction is to replace the subject pronoun with the object pronoun when the verb is in the past tense? Let's check other examples.\n\nSecond pair:  \nInput: I can't tell the difference between these two.  \nOutput: I find it hard to distinguish between them.  \nOriginal uses \"can't tell the difference\", output uses \"find it hard to distinguish\". These are two different ways of expressing the same idea, but the structure changes. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence using synonyms or alternative phrasing while maintaining the meaning.\n\nThird input-output:  \nInput: Do you want me to go with you?  \nOutput: Shall I accompany you?  \nThis seems like a change in sentence structure. The original is a question asking if the listener wants the speaker to go along, and the output is a more formal request (\"Shall I...\") which is a common way to rephrase such questions. So perhaps the instruction is to convert certain types of questions into polite requests.\n\nFourth input-output:  \nInput: I got what you said.  \nOutput: I understood you.  \nHere, \"got\" is replaced with \"understood\", which is a synonym. So maybe the instruction involves replacing certain phrases or words with their synonyms to convey the same meaning.\n\nFifth input-output:  \nInput: This song is fire.  \nOutput: This song is incredibly good.  \nThe original slang phrase \"fire\" is rephrased as a more formal adjective \"incredibly good\". So this suggests replacing informal expressions with more standard phrasing.\n\nNow, looking for a common thread across all these transformations. Each input-output pair seems to involve rephrasing the input into a more formal or grammatically correct version, possibly with some synonyms or different structures. Let's see:\n\n1. The first example replaces \"I\" with \"whom\" when the verb is past tense. Wait, but \"met\" is past tense, and \"whom\" is the object pronoun. So maybe the rule is: when the subject pronoun is followed by a past tense verb that requires an object, replace the subject pronoun with the object pronoun? For example, \"I met him\" would become \"him met me\"? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, in the first example, the input is \"I met\", but the output is \"whom met\". Wait, no, the output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the \"I\" is part of a relative clause. The original \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\". So perhaps the instruction is to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in any case where it's the subject of a verb within a subordinate clause? But that might not be consistent. For example, in \"He saw me\", replacing \"me\" with \"who\" gives \"He saw who\", which isn't correct. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, in the first example, the original sentence is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, \"I met\" is part of the relative clause modifying \"lawyer\". The subject of the relative clause is \"I\", so replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" because it's the object in the main clause? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe whenever there's an indirect object or direct object pronoun being converted to its possessive form? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert possessive pronouns to their object forms. But in the first input, there's no possessive pronoun. Let's check the other examples:\n\nThird input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Output is \"Shall I accompany you?\" So the original uses \"me to go\", output uses \"accompany you\". So here, \"me to go\" is replaced with \"accompany you\". That's a different structure altogether. So perhaps the instruction is to turn certain questions into imperatives or conditional phrases? Or maybe rephrase using different verbs.\n\nFourth input: \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you\". Here, \"got\" is replaced with \"understood\". So that's a synonym replacement.\n\nFifth input: Slang \"fire\" replaced with \"incredibly good\".\n\nSo the instruction seems to involve various types of transformations: changing possessives to object pronouns (maybe?), rephrasing questions into polite requests, replacing synonyms, converting informal slang, and adjusting grammar (like \"I met\" to \"whom I met\"). But how to unify these?\n\nLet me look for common patterns. All the outputs seem more formal than the inputs. For example:\n\nFirst input is informal (using \"was helpful\" instead of a longer phrase). Output is more descriptive. Second input changes \"can't tell\" to \"find it hard to distinguish\"—more formal. Third input is a question phrased as a request, fourth replaces \"got\" with \"understood\", fifth replaces slang with more formal.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the instruction is to convert the input into a more polite or formal register. For example, changing \"Do you...\" to \"Shall I...\", replacing contractions, rephrasing verbs with synonyms, and adjusting pronoun usage.\n\nBut why does the first example involve changing \"I\" to \"whom\"? That might fit if the instruction is to adjust pronoun case in certain contexts. Wait, in the first input, \"I met yesterday\" is part of the relative clause \"the lawyer I met yesterday\". So \"I\" is the subject of the relative clause. But in the output, it's changed to \"whom\". So perhaps the rule is: whenever a relative clause has \"I\" as the subject, replace it with \"whom\"? That would explain the first example. Let's test this with another example.\n\nTake the third input-output pair: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" Here, \"me\" is the object of the verb \"want\", so maybe in cases where a pronoun is the object of a verb in a main clause, it's changed to \"me\", but in the output, the verb becomes \"accompany\" and the pronoun is \"I\". Hmm, that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to replace possessive pronouns with their object forms. For example, in the first input, there's no possessive, but in other examples, like \"I\" being replaced with \"my\" or something else. Let's see:\n\nIn the first output: \"whom I met\". So \"I\" is in the relative clause. If the rule is to replace \"I\" with \"me\" in relative clauses, but the output uses \"whom\", which is the objective case. Wait, but \"whom\" is the objective case. So maybe the rule is to replace the subject \"I\" with \"me\" when it's the object of a verb, but in the first example, the \"I\" is the subject of the relative clause, so replacing it with \"whom\"? That seems possible. For example, \"the person I love\" becomes \"the person whom I love\". Similarly, in the first example, \"I met\" becomes \"whom met\". But in the output, it's \"whom I met\". So that would require moving the \"I\" after the relative pronoun. Wait, the original is \"I met\", which is the subject of the relative clause. So replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" would give \"whom met\", but the output is \"whom I met\", which adds the original \"I\" before the verb. That doesn't quite make sense. Maybe there's a confusion here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace \"I\" with \"me\" wherever it appears in a sentence, regardless of case. But in the first example, the output has \"whom\" instead of \"I\". That contradicts. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the instruction is to convert all pronouns into their object forms. For example, \"I\" becomes \"me\", \"you\" becomes \"you\", etc., but in the first example, the output is \"whom\", which is the objective case. Wait, \"whom\" is used when the pronoun is the object of a verb or preposition. So in the first example, \"I met\" is the subject of the main clause. But when it's part of the relative clause \"the lawyer I met yesterday\", \"I\" is the subject of the relative clause, which would require the subjective case. However, in the output, it's changed to \"whom\", which is the objective case. So that might indicate that the instruction is to always use the objective case in relative clauses. But that's not standard English grammar. Normally, relative clauses use the subjective case unless the relative pronoun is preceded by a preposition. For example, \"the man I know\" vs. \"the man whom I know\".\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is: whenever there is a pronoun in a relative clause, replace it with the corresponding objective pronoun. Let's check the first example: \"the lawyer I met yesterday\" becomes \"the lawyer whom I met yesterday\". That fits. Now let's see if this applies to other examples.\n\nThird example: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" The \"me\" is the object of \"want\", so changing to \"whom\" would make \"Do you want whom to go with you?\" which doesn't make sense. So that doesn't fit. Therefore, this rule only applies to the first example, but not others. So that can't be the general instruction.\n\nLooking back at the first input-output pair again. The output replaces \"I\" with \"whom\". So maybe the instruction is to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in all instances? But that doesn't align with standard grammar rules. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert the subject \"I\" to \"me\" when it's the object of a preposition or verb. Wait, in the first example, \"I met\" is the subject of the main clause and the relative clause. So replacing \"I\" with \"me\" would give \"me met\", which is incorrect. But the output uses \"whom\", which is the objective case. So that suggests a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to adjust pronoun cases based on their function in the sentence. For example, in the first input, \"I\" is the subject of the main clause and the relative clause, so it remains as \"I\". But in the output, it's changed to \"whom\". That doesn't make sense unless there's a specific context. Maybe the instruction is to change \"I\" to \"me\" when it follows a preposition? For example, \"I am a friend of me\" becomes \"I am a friend of me\" (no change), but \"Me, not you.\" becomes \"Me, not you.\" Still not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the first example is an exception, and the other outputs follow different rules. Let's consider the other examples again:\n\nSecond input-output: \"I can't tell the difference...\" becomes \"I find it hard to distinguish...\". So here, the instruction could be to rephrase the sentence using synonyms. \"Can't tell the difference\" is replaced with \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n\nThird input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" This seems like turning a question into a request. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase questions into polite commands or suggestions.\n\nFourth input: \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\". Replacing \"got\" with \"understood\" and adjusting the pronoun case (\"me\" to \"you\").\n\nFifth input: \"This song is fire\" → \"This song is incredibly good\". Replacing slang with more formal terms.\n\nSo putting this together, the instruction might involve a combination of rephrasing questions into polite requests, adjusting pronoun cases, replacing informal language with more formal equivalents, and synonym substitution. But how to unify these?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to convert the input into a more formal or polite version. For example, using more sophisticated vocabulary, adjusting the sentence structure for politeness, replacing contractions, etc.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they often use \"Shall I\" instead of \"Do you want me to\". That's a common politeness formula, replacing questions with suggestions. Similarly, \"I find it hard to distinguish\" is a more formal way of saying \"I can't tell the difference\".\n\nIn the fifth example, slang \"fire\" is replaced with \"incredibly good\", which is a more descriptive and formal term.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is: Convert informal, colloquial, or direct language into more formal, polite, or refined phrasing by replacing contractions, changing verb tenses or forms, adjusting sentence structure, replacing slangs with synonyms, and rephrasing questions into polite imperatives.\n\nBut then why does the first example involve changing \"I\" to \"whom\"? Because \"I met\" in the original becomes \"whom I met\" in the output. Let's analyze that sentence.\n\nOriginal: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"  \nOutput: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\nThe subject of the main clause is \"The lawyer\". The relative clause starts with \"I met yesterday\". The antecedent is \"lawyer\", so the relative pronoun should be \"who\" (subjective case) if it's serving as the subject of the relative clause. Wait, \"I met\" is the subject of the relative clause. Wait, the relative clause is \"that/who I met yesterday\". Since the antecedent is \"lawyer\", which is a noun, the relative pronoun should be \"who\" when referring to people. So the original \"I\" should be \"who\". But in the output, it's changed to \"whom\". That suggests that maybe the instruction is to replace \"who\" with \"whom\" when the pronoun is the object of the relative clause.\n\nWait, but \"I\" in the original is the subject of the relative clause. So normally, it should be \"who\". Changing \"I\" to \"whom\" would be incorrect unless there's a mistake in the original. But the input has \"I\", and the output has \"whom\". That seems like a possible error unless the instruction specifically requires changing \"I\" to \"whom\" in all instances, which isn't grammatically correct. So this makes me doubt whether the first example is actually part of the instruction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to replace all instances of \"I\" with \"me\", but that doesn't align with the first example's output. Unless the input had a typo. For example, if the input was \"The lawyer me met yesterday...\", but that doesn't make sense. So this is confusing.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, maybe I should consider that the first example is an exception, and the main instruction applies to the other four examples. Let's try to find a unifying instruction that covers the second, third, fourth, and fifth examples.\n\nLooking at the second input-output pair: The original uses \"can't tell\", output uses \"find it hard to distinguish\". So this is replacing \"can't\" with \"find it hard to\" and \"difference\" with \"distinguish\". So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase using different verbs or phrases.\n\nThird input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\" Here, the structure changes from a question to a suggestion. So maybe the instruction is to convert questions that ask for permission or assistance into polite offers or suggestions.\n\nFourth input: \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\". The verb \"got\" is replaced with \"understood\", which is a synonym. So perhaps the instruction includes replacing certain verbs with their synonyms.\n\nFifth input: \"fire\" is replaced with \"incredibly good\". Again, a synonym replacement for slang.\n\nSo combining these observations, the instruction could be: \"Convert the input into a more formal or polite version by replacing contractions with full phrases, rephrasing questions into polite requests, replacing informal or direct language with more refined vocabulary (synonyms, more descriptive adjectives), adjusting sentence structure for politeness, and modifying pronoun cases where appropriate.\"\n\nBut how to confirm this? Let's test this hypothesis against the first example. The output changed \"I\" to \"whom\", which isn't typically done unless there's a grammatical reason. If the instruction is about politeness, then maybe \"whom\" is more formal. But generally, \"whom\" is used when it's the object of a verb. In the original sentence, \"I met\" is the subject of the relative clause. So normally, it should be \"who\". Changing \"I\" to \"whom\" might be incorrect, unless the instruction explicitly required that change. This inconsistency makes me uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to replace \"I\" with \"me\" when it's the object of a verb or preposition. Let's check:\n\nOriginal: \"I met yesterday\" (subject of main clause) → Output: \"whom I met\" (object of the preposition \"by\" or part of the relative clause). Wait, the relative clause is \"I met yesterday\", where \"I\" is the subject. So in a relative clause, the relative pronoun refers to the noun it modifies. If \"lawyer\" is the antecedent, then the relative pronoun should be \"who\" (subjective case). But in the output, it's \"whom\". So that's not following standard grammar. Therefore, this must be either a mistake or the instruction requires changing \"I\" to \"whom\" regardless of grammar.\n\nGiven that the other outputs don't have such inconsistencies, maybe the first example is a special case, possibly due to a typo in the input or misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to replace \"I\" with \"me\" whenever it follows a preposition. But in the first example, there's no preposition. This is getting too complicated.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to look for a common pattern across all outputs. Let's list the outputs again and see what they have in common:\n\n1. \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" – More formal, uses \"whom\".\n2. \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" – More formal, rephrases \"can't tell\".\n3. \"Shall I accompany you?\" – Polite request instead of question.\n4. \"I understood you.\" – Replaces \"got\" with \"understood\".\n5. \"This song is incredibly good.\" – Replaces slang with formal description.\n\nSo each output is more formal than the input, uses",

Hmm, first, I need to look at each pair and see if there's a common transformation or rule applied. Let's start by analyzing each example.\n\nLooking at the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"I can't stand his temper.\"\nOutput: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\nSo here, the main difference is \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate\". Both mean not liking someone's behavior. Maybe the instruction is to replace certain phrases with more formal synonyms?\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: \"I considered many approaches.\"\nOutput: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\nOriginal is active voice with \"considered by I\". The output uses passive voice and replaces \"many\" with \"various\". So perhaps the instruction is to convert the sentence to passive voice and use more formal adjectives?\n\nThird pair:\nInput: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\"\nOutput: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\nThis seems like changing the advice from negative (\"don't think it's a good idea\") to a positive suggestion using \"it is suggested\". Also, changing \"anything right now\" to \"no action should be taken at this stage\". So maybe the instruction is to rephrase negative advice into a formal suggestion phrased as a positive obligation?\n\nFourth input-output:\nInput: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nOutput: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nHere, the prepositional phrase \"I met yesterday\" becomes \"whom I met yesterday\". The original uses the subject case \"I\", which is informal, while the output uses \"whom\" and keeps \"I\" in the relative clause. So perhaps the instruction is to formalize the grammar by replacing \"I\" with \"me\" when it's part of a prepositional phrase or after \"whom\"?\n\nFifth pair:\nInput: \"The whole story was made up.\"\nOutput: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\nDirect object \"was made up\" changes to \"was fabricated\". Both mean created unrealistically, but using more formal terminology. So maybe replace informal expressions with their more formal equivalents, using appropriate nouns or verbs.\n\nNow, putting all these together, the instruction likely involves multiple transformations depending on the context. Let's list possible categories from the examples:\n\n1. Replace informal expressions with formal ones (like \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\").\n2. Change sentence structure (active to passive voice) for formality.\n3. Rephrase negative advice into positive suggestions (using \"is suggested\").\n4. Formalize pronoun usage (replace \"I\" with \"me\" in certain positions and use \"whom\").\n5. Substitute idiomatic expressions with more formal equivalents (e.g., \"made up\" → \"fabricated\").\n\nWait, but looking at the first four examples, the first three involve rephrasing for formality and structure, and the fifth is vocabulary substitution. However, the fourth example is about changing \"I\" to \"whom\". But in the fourth input, the original is \"I met yesterday,\" which is a prepositional phrase. The output uses \"whom\" there. So maybe the instruction is to make the writing more formal by applying specific grammar rules, such as using \"whom\" instead of \"who\" where appropriate, but only in certain contexts.\n\nBut let's check if that's consistent across all examples. For instance, the second example doesn't have any pronoun changes, but the third does. The first example has \"can't stand\" replaced with \"cannot tolerate\". The fourth example has \"I\" replaced with \"whom\". The fifth is vocabulary.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the instruction is to translate the input into a more formal register. That could include various changes like verb tenses (but none seem to change tense), pronoun forms, vocabulary, sentence structure.\n\nBut looking at the first example, \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" — that's a phrasal replacement. The second example uses passive voice. Third example converts a negative statement into a suggestion. Fourth uses formal pronoun \"whom\". Fifth substitutes \"entire\" for \"whole\".\n\nSo maybe the instruction was to take each input and rewrite it in a more formal or professional style, applying different transformations based on the context. Each input might require a specific type of modification. However, the problem states that the friend followed the same instruction for each input. Therefore, the instruction must be a general set of rules that can be applied to any input to produce the corresponding output.\n\nWait, but the outputs vary in different ways. Let's see if there's a pattern.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Changing \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\" suggests replacing contractions with non-contracted forms.\n- \"I considered\" → \"Various approaches were considered\": changed subject (I to various), active to passive.\n- \"don't think it's a good idea\" → \"It is suggested that...\" which is a formal way to present advice.\n- \"The lawyer I met yesterday...\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday...\": changed possessive \"I met\" to \"whom I met\".\n- \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to rewrite the input sentence in a more formal style, possibly involving several transformations depending on the original structure.\n\nBut how to combine all these into a single instruction? Maybe the instruction is to \"formalize the sentences by replacing informal expressions with more formal alternatives, converting to passive voice when necessary, restructuring sentences to avoid contractions, and using appropriate grammar rules such as replacing 'I' with 'whom' in certain clauses and replacing informal terms with more precise vocabulary.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is specifically to use \"whom\" in place of \"who\" where appropriate, avoid contractions, use passive voice, etc. But the first example shows that \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate\", which isn't directly related to \"whom\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate each input into a more formal version by using a thesaurus for synonyms, but that seems too vague. Or perhaps it's a mix of grammar rules and vocabulary substitution.\n\nWait, another approach: look for common elements between the instructions. Let's note that:\n\n- In the first example, \"can't\" becomes \"cannot\".\n- In the second, active voice becomes passive, \"I considered\" → \"were considered\".\n- Third, negative advice becomes a suggestion phrased positively.\n- Fourth, \"I\" in a prepositional phrase becomes \"whom\".\n- Fifth, \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated\".\n\nLooking at these, the fifth is a synonym swap. The fourth is a grammar rule (using \"whom\"). The others involve more structural changes. The third involves changing the perspective from negative to positive suggestion.\n\nBut how to unify these under a single instruction?\n\nPerhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal, written style. This could involve:\n\n1. Avoiding contractions by replacing them with non-contracted forms.\n2. Using passive voice instead of active voice where appropriate (as in the second example).\n3. Restructuring sentences to present suggestions in a more formal way (like changing \"don't think\" to \"it is suggested\").\n4. Using more formal pronouns like \"whom\" instead of \"who\" or \"I\" in certain positions (fourth example).\n5. Replacing informal expressions with more precise vocabulary (fifth example).\n\nBut even then, how to describe this concisely?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to transform the sentence into a more formal register by replacing certain words or phrases, adjusting grammar, and changing sentence structures as needed. Each input may require applying a combination of these steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to use \"whom\" whenever it refers to a person in a prepositional phrase, avoid contractions, use passive voice, rephrase negative statements into positive suggestions, and replace informal vocabulary with formal terms.\n\nBut to cover all these in a single instruction, perhaps the instruction was something like:\n\n\"Formalize each input by replacing contractions with their expanded forms, using passive voice where applicable, restructuring negative advice into a polite suggestion phrased as a positive obligation, replacing 'I' with 'whom' in certain clauses, and substituting informal terms with more formal equivalents.\"\n\nHowever, the fifth example doesn't involve restructuring a negative statement; it's just a synonym swap. The fourth example is a grammar change. The third is a significant rephrasing of the entire sentence into a suggestion.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, each one seems to target a specific issue in the original input. For example:\n\n- Input 1: contraction (\"can't\") → expanded form (\"cannot\").\n- Input 2: active voice → passive, replaced \"many\" with \"various\".\n- Input 3: negative advice → positive suggestion.\n- Input 4: informal possessive clause (\"I met\") → formalized with \"whom\".\n- Input 5: informal expression \"made up\" → formal \"fabricated\".\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to address common informal elements by applying multiple transformation rules. Each input might require applying some subset of these rules. But since the friend applied the same instruction to all inputs, the instruction must be a general set of guidelines that collectively transform the input into the output, regardless of specific changes needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rewrite the input using \"whom\" in place of \"who\" or \"I\" when they follow certain prepositions, replace contractions, use passive voice, rephrase advice into suggestions, and substitute synonyms for informal words.\n\nGiven that the outputs show a variety of transformations, the instruction likely combines several language editing techniques. To formulate this into a single clear instruction, we might need to list the key points:\n\n- Replace contractions with non-contracted forms (like \"I can't\" → \"I cannot\").\n- Convert active voice to passive voice where possible.\n- Restructure negative statements into polite suggestions using phrases like \"it is suggested\" or \"should be\".\n- Use formal pronouns like \"whom\" instead of \"who\" or \"I\" in certain clauses.\n- Substitute informal expressions with more precise vocabulary (e.g., \"made up\" → \"fabricated\").\n\nBut how to combine these into a concise instruction? Maybe the original instruction was to \"rephrase each sentence into a more formal register, adjusting grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure as necessary.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be more specific, such as:\n\n\"Convert each input sentence into a more formal version by:\n\n1. Replacing contractions with their expanded forms.\n2. Using passive voice when appropriate.\n3. Rephrasing negative statements into a positive suggestion phrased as a polite obligation.\n4. Using the relative pronoun 'whom' instead of 'who' when referring to people in a prepositional phrase.\n5. Substituting informal terms with their formal equivalents.\"\n\nThis would cover all the transformations observed in the examples. For instance:\n\n- \"I can't stand...\" becomes \"I cannot tolerate...\" (contraction removed).\n- \"I considered...\" → \"Various approaches were considered...\" (passive voice, \"considered\" changed to \"were considered\" to match subject-verb agreement, and \"many\" replaced with \"various\").\n- \"don't think...\" → \"It is suggested that...\" (negative advice converted to a formal suggestion).\n- \"I met yesterday...\" → \"whom I met yesterday\" (replaced \"I\" with \"whom\" in the relative clause).\n- \"made up\" → \"fabricated\" (substitution of informal term with formal).\n\nEach step addresses a different aspect of formality and correctness, and applying all these rules transforms the inputs into the outputs shown. Therefore, the instruction likely involved a combination of these grammatical and lexical adjustments to formalize the input sentences.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to your friend was to **rephrase each input sentence into a more formal register**, systematically applying the following transformations based on context:\n\n1. **Remove Contractions**: Expand informal contractions (e.g., \"I can't\" → \"I cannot\").\n2. **Passive Voice Conversion**: Rewrite active sentences in passive voice when applicable (e.g., \"I considered\" → \"Various approaches were considered\").\n3. **Negative Advice to Suggestion**: Recast negative statements into polite suggestions phrased formally (e.g., \"We don’t think...\" → \"It is suggested that...\").\n4. **Grammar Rules**: Use \"whom\" instead of \"who\" or \"I\" in certain prepositional clauses (e.g., \"I met\" → \"whom I met\").\n5. **Vocabulary Refinement**: Substitute informal terms with formal equivalents (e.g., \"made up\" → \"fabricated\").\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, your friend produced outputs aligned with the given examples through a blend of syntactic restructuring, lexical substitution, and adherence to formal grammatical norms.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs where a friend generated outputs based on the given instructions. My job is to deduce the rule or transformation that connects each input to its corresponding output.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the inputs and their outputs again to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nInput 1: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\nHmm, comparing these. The original is a casual greeting, and the output is a more formal or perhaps a slight variation. Let me check another example.\n\nInput 2: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" \nSo here, the output is a rephrased question using \"would\" instead of \"can\", and \"accomplish\" instead of \"do\". Also, \"these tasks\" becomes \"all these tasks\" in the output? Wait, no, the input says \"Can you do all these tasks?\" which includes \"all these\", but the output is \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" So maybe \"all these\" isn't changed. Wait, looking again:\n\nOriginal: \"Can you do all these tasks?\"\nOutput: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n\nSo \"do\" becomes \"be able to accomplish\". The structure changes from a present tense ability question to a conditional possibility. So maybe replacing \"can\" with \"would...able\" and changing the verb. Also, \"do all these\" becomes \"be able to accomplish all these\".\n\nThird input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\nSo here, \"can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish\". The subject changes from \"I\" to \"I\" (same), but the verbs and phrases change. \"can't tell\" vs. \"find it hard\". \"difference between these two\" becomes \"distinguish between them\".\n\nFourth input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\nSo the input is a direct thanks, and the output is a more formal or appreciative response. The person being thanked is addressed with \"your\" and transformed into \"Your assistance is...\" which shifts the focus to their help rather than just thanking them.\n\nFifth input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\nThe input is a first-person statement, and the output is a third-person passive voice construction. The number of approaches changes from \"many\" to \"various\", which might be synonyms here. \"Considered\" remains the same but is turned into passive voice.\n\nNow, looking at all these transformations, I need to find a common rule. Let's categorize each input-output pair's changes:\n\n1. Tone and formality:\n- Input 1: Casual → Output more formal.\n- Input 2: Question → Output rephrases as a conditional possibility.\n- Input 3: Expressing inability → Output expresses difficulty.\n- Input 4: Direct thanks → Output formal gratitude.\n- Input 5: First-person active → Third-person passive.\n\nPossible patterns:\n- For input 1, changing \"see you\" to \"look forward to meeting\".\nWait, \"see you\" is informal, while \"look forward to meeting\" is more formal. Similarly, input 3's \"can't tell\" becomes \"find it hard\", which is a more indirect expression. Input 4 shifts the thanks into a structured expression of appreciation. Input 5 changes the perspective from first to third person, uses passive voice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence into a more polite or formal version. Let's check:\n\nInput 1: \"See you tonight.\" → Formal greeting. \"I look forward to meeting you\" is indeed a polite way to say \"See you\", often used in emails or letters.\n\nInput 2: Question about capability → Output suggests uncertainty with \"Would you be able...\" This seems like turning a simple question into a conditional possibility. But why not just answer \"Yes\"? Maybe the output is seeking confirmation rather than a direct yes/no.\n\nInput 3: \"Can't tell the difference\" → \"Find it hard to distinguish\". Both mean the same but expressed differently. Perhaps the output is a more indirect or hesitant way of saying that.\n\nInput 4: Simple thanks → Output uses \"assistance\" and \"much appreciated\", which is more formal.\n\nInput 5: \"I considered\" → Passive \"were considered\". Changing subject and tense.\n\nAnother angle: The instruction might involve restructuring sentences to fit certain contexts. For example, maybe transforming casual statements into professional or academic language. Alternatively, converting questions into requests for confirmation, etc.\n\nLet me look for possible instruction keywords. If we think about what these transformations have in common, perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or indirect equivalent. However, some examples don't fit this:\n\nInput 5: \"I considered many approaches\" → \"Various approaches were considered\". Here, the act of considering becomes the consideration of various approaches. So the instruction might involve restating the original action in terms of what was done, perhaps using passive voice and synonyms.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to transform the input into a passive voice structure, but only in cases where the subject is changed to third person. For example, \"I did X\" becomes \"X was done\", but only if the subject is first person singular. However, input 5 is \"I considered...\", which becomes \"Various approaches were considered.\" So \"considered\" is passive here, but the subject is \"approaches\" instead of \"I\".\n\nLooking at input 1: Original is first person, output is third person (\"you\"). Input 2 is a second person question to first person. Input 3 is first person. Input 4 is second person. Input 5 is first person.\n\nSo the instruction might involve changing the perspective of the speaker. For example, input 1's \"you\" becomes third person. Input 2's \"you\" becomes first person. Input 4's \"your\" becomes \"Your\". So maybe the instruction is to switch the perspective, making the sentence about the listener/reader instead of the original speaker.\n\nWait, let's analyze each input's perspective:\n\nInput 1: \"See you\" → second person, addressing the listener. Output is first person, referring to the speaker looking forward to meeting the listener.\n\nInput 2: Second person question → Output is first person question (using \"you\" but asking about yourself). Wait, original input is \"Can you...\", output is \"Would you be able to...\". So the perspective is still on the listener's capability, but phrased as \"Would you...\", which is first person but still referring to the listener. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to rephrase into a passive voice structure. Let's check input 5 again: \"I considered\" → \"Various approaches were considered\". So the passive voice is used. Input 4's output is also passive (\"Your assistance is much appreciated\" is a bit different, but maybe not exactly passive). Wait, \"is appreciated\" is passive, but \"assistance is much appreciated\" might be a noun phrase. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction is to convert the input into a different part of speech. For example, adjectives to nouns, etc., but I don't see that in the examples.\n\nAnother angle: The output often involves more complex phrasing. For example, input 1's output has more words, \"I look forward to\" versus \"See you\". Input 2's output adds \"Would you be able to\" instead of just \"can you\".\n\nLooking at the first example: \"See you\" is a greeting, replaced with a longer phrase expressing anticipation. That's common in more formal situations, like business emails. The second input takes a question about capability and turns it into a more tentative request, possibly because the answerer is unsure or wants the other person to confirm. Third input replaces a direct negative (\"can't tell\") with a softer \"find it hard\". Fourth input turns a direct thank you into a more formal appreciation. Fifth input changes the perspective from first to third person and uses passive voice.\n\nPutting this together, the instruction might be to rephrase each input into a more polite or professional version. Let's test this hypothesis against all examples:\n\n1. Input: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This is a polite way to say \"See you\", so yes, more formal.\n\n2. Input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" The original is a simple request; the output is more polite and uses \"be able to\", which is a way of asking permission politely. Also, \"do\" becomes \"accomplish\", which is more formal.\n\n3. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" This is a more indirect way of expressing the same idea, often used in formal or careful communication.\n\n4. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" This is a standard way to turn a direct thanks into a more formal acknowledgment of the help received.\n\n5. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\" Changing \"considered\" to \"were considered\" puts it in passive voice, which can be more formal and avoids the subject (\"I\"). It also uses \"various\" as a synonym, which might fit a more academic tone.\n\nThis seems to align with the idea of making each input more polite, formal, or cautious. The instruction could be to rephrase the input into a more professional or considerate response, often through the use of more polite phrasing, passive voice, or indirect expressions.\n\nTo confirm, let's see if there's an instruction that would cover all these examples. One possible instruction is: \"Rephrase each input into a more polite or formal version.\" Alternatively, \"Transform each input into a more indirect or considerate statement.\"\n\nAnother possible instruction could be: \"Rearrange each sentence to express the same meaning but using different wording, often in a more polite or formal style.\"\n\nAlternatively, breaking down the examples:\n\nFor input 1: Change \"see you\" to \"look forward to meeting you,\" which is more formal.\n\nFor input 2: Convert \"can you\" to \"would you be able to,\" which is a more tentative and polite phrasing.\n\nInput 3: \"Can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish,\" a softer expression.\n\nInput 4: \"Thanks for your help\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated,\" a standard form of thanks.\n\nInput 5: Change perspective from first to third person and use passive voice.\n\nThese transformations are all aimed at making the response more polite or formal. The key elements are:\n\n- Using \"I look forward to\" instead of \"See you\"\n- Adding politeness markers like \"would you be able to\" and \"Your assistance is\"\n- Softening direct statements (\"can't tell\" → \"find it hard\")\n- Using passive voice to avoid direct subjectivity (\"were considered\" instead of \"I considered\")\n- Turning gratitude into more formal expressions.\n\nThus, the instruction likely asks the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, often by altering the perspective, using different phrasing, adding politeness markers, and adjusting verb structures.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction given was: **\"Rewrite each input into a more polite or formal version, adjusting perspective, phrasing, and verb structures as necessary.\"**\n\n### Analysis of Each Pair:\n1. **Input:** \"See you tonight.\"  \n   **Output:** \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"  \n   - *Transformation:* Replaces casual \"see you\" with formal \"look forward to,\" emphasizing anticipation.\n\n2. **Input:** \"Can you do all these tasks?\"  \n   **Output:** \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"  \n   - *Transformation:* Uses \"would...able\" (polite phrasing) and \"accomplish\" (formal verb).\n\n3. **Input:** \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\"  \n   **Output:** \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"  \n   - *Transformation:* Softens \"can't tell\" to \"find it hard,\" avoiding direct negation.\n\n4. **Input:** \"Thanks for your help.\"  \n   **Output:** \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"  \n   - *Transformation:* Redirects thanks to \"assistance\" and adds formal \"much appreciated.\"\n\n5. **Input:** \"I considered many approaches.\"  \n   **Output:** \"Various approaches were considered.\"  \n   - *Transformation:* Passivizes the verb (\"considered\" → \"were considered\"), shifts subject to \"approaches,\" and uses \"various\" for synonymy.\n\n### Common Theme:\nAll outputs reflect a **shift towards politeness, formality, or indirect expression**. Key adjustments include:\n- **Perspective changes** (e.g., first-person to third-person, \"you\" to more formal constructs).\n- **Politeness markers** (e.g., \"would...able,\" \"Your assistance\").\n- **Formal language** (e.g., \"appreciated,\" \"distinguish\").\n- **Softened expressions** (e.g., \"find it hard\" instead of \"can't tell\").\n\nThis instruction emphasizes transforming direct, informal statements into measured, professional responses.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The friend took each input and produced the corresponding output as shown. So, my job is to reverse-engineer what the original instruction could have been that transforms each input into the respective output. \n\nFirst, I'll list out the input-output pairs again to see if there's a pattern:\n\n1. Input: She looks like her sister. → Output: She resembles her sister.\n2. Input: The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful. → Output: The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\n3. Input: Can you do all these tasks? → Output: Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\n4. Input: This song is fire. → Output: This song is incredibly good.\n5. Input: The whole story was made up. → Output: The entire story was fabricated.\n\nHmm. Let me analyze each pair to see possible transformations.\n\nStarting with the first one: \"She looks like her sister\" becomes \"She resembles her sister.\" The key difference here is the verb \"looks like\" vs. \"resembles\". So maybe the instruction is to replace \"look like\" with \"resemble\"? But wait, in the second input, the verb isn't \"look like\" but \"was helpful\". The output changes \"was helpful\" to \"was helpful\" but adds a relative pronoun \"whom\". Wait, no—second input's output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the original had \"I met yesterday\", and the output is \"whom I met yesterday\". Oh! So the second input changed \"met\" to \"whom met\". Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the original input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the only change here is replacing \"I\" with \"whom\". So the instruction might be to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" when it comes after a past tense verb. Wait, but in this case, the structure is \"I met yesterday\". So the output is \"whom met yesterday\". So the original subject was \"I\", and the output has \"whom\". That's interesting. So perhaps whenever \"I\" appears in a sentence after a verb in the past tense (like \"met\"), it should be replaced with \"whom\"?\n\nLooking at the other examples. Let's check the third input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" becomes \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" The output seems to be rephrasing \"can\" into \"be able to\", but also changing the verb structure. The original is a question using \"can\", and the output uses \"Would you be...\" which is a different structure. Wait, maybe the instruction is to turn the sentence into a more formal or polite version? For example, replacing \"can\" with \"be able to\" and rephrasing the sentence structure. But in the third example, the input is a question starting with \"Can\", and the output is \"Would you be able...\", which is a different question structure. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase the request into a more polite form, changing the verb from \"can\" to \"be able to\" and adjusting the structure. \n\nFourth input: \"This song is fire.\" → \"This song is incredibly good.\" Here, \"fire\" is slang meaning great, so the output translates it to \"incredibly good\". So perhaps the instruction was to replace informal expressions with more standard terms, or translate slang to their meanings.\n\nFifth input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Here, \"whole\" becomes \"entire\" and \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated\". So maybe the instruction was to replace certain adjectives or phrases with their synonyms. \n\nNow, looking back at the first two outputs. The first one changes \"looks like\" to \"resembles\". The second one replaces \"I\" with \"whom\" in a past tense context. The third one changes the entire sentence structure and phrasing. Fourth changes slang to standard term. Fifth changes \"whole\" to \"entire\" and \"made up\" to \"fabricated\". \n\nSo the instruction might be a combination of different transformations. But how can all these transformations fit under a single instruction? Let me think about possible instructions that could lead to these outputs.\n\nOne possible approach is to look for a common thread between all the outputs. For instance, the first transformation involves changing a phrasal verb (\"look like\" to \"resemble\"). The second involves changing a personal pronoun (\"I\" to \"whom\") in a specific context. The third involves rephrasing a question into a different form. The fourth is substituting slang. The fifth is replacing words with synonyms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input belongs to a category that requires a specific transformation. For example, the first two inputs might require a grammatical correction or substitution, while the others are different types of transformations. But the problem states that the instruction was given once, and the friend applied it to all inputs. So the instruction must cover all these cases.\n\nWait, let's think about the outputs again. The first two outputs seem to involve replacing certain words or phrases with others. The third is restructuring the sentence. The fourth is replacing slang. The fifth is synonym replacement.\n\nIs there a unifying instruction that could generate all these? Let's consider possible instructions:\n\n1. Rewrite each input by replacing informal expressions with more formal ones. But then the third input's output is more formal, but the fifth input's output uses \"entire\" instead of \"whole\", which is more formal but not necessarily informal. Hmm.\n\n2. Alternatively, perhaps each input is part of a specific type of language correction. For example:\n   - First input: Changing \"look like\" to \"resemble\".\n   - Second input: Changing \"I\" to \"whom\" in certain contexts.\n   - Third input: Replacing \"can\" with \"be able to\".\n   - Fourth input: Replacing slang \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\".\n   - Fifth input: Changing \"whole\" to \"entire\" and \"made up\" to \"fabricated\".\n\nBut this seems too fragmented. There must be a common thread.\n\nWait, maybe the instruction was to translate the inputs into a more formal or standard version. Let's check:\n\nFirst input: \"She looks like her sister\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" Less formal than \"resembles\"?\nWait, \"resembles\" is actually more formal than \"looks like\". But the output is more formal, so maybe the instruction is to make the sentences more formal. But the second input's output is less formal in terms of grammar (\"whom\" is more formal, but the rest is the same). Third input's output is more formal. Fourth input's output is more formal. Fifth input's output is more formal. But the first input's output is also more formal. So maybe the instruction is to convert the input into a more formal version. However, the first transformation from \"looks like\" to \"resembles\" makes the sentence more formal, which fits. The second input's output uses \"whom\" which is more formal than \"I\", but the rest is similar. So maybe the instruction is to apply various formalization rules, but that seems inconsistent across all examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to translate the input into a different language, but all outputs are in English. Not likely.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe each input is part of a different context where the instruction applies a specific rule. For example:\n\n1. Replace \"look like\" with \"resemble\".\n2. Replace \"I\" with \"whom\" when followed by a past tense verb.\n3. Convert \"Can you...\" questions into \"Would you be able to...\" form.\n4. Replace slang terms.\n5. Replace \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\".\n\nBut this requires multiple separate instructions, which contradicts the fact that there was one instruction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to translate each input into a version that's more polite or respectful. Let's check:\n\nFirst input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" Doesn't seem more polite. \"Resemble\" is more formal but not necessarily polite.\n\nSecond input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Adding \"whom\" makes it more formal but perhaps more polite? Though \"whom\" is often avoided in modern English.\n\nThird input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" This is definitely more polite and formal. Using \"would\" and \"be able to\" both make it more formal and polite.\n\nFourth input: Slang \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\". This is replacing slang with a more descriptive phrase, which could be considered making it more formal or clear.\n\nFifth input: \"whole story was made up\" → \"entire story was fabricated\". Here, \"made up\" is informal, \"fabricated\" is more formal. Also, \"entire\" is a synonym for \"whole\".\n\nIf we consider that the instruction is to make the sentences more formal and polite, then:\n\n- The first input uses \"resembles\" which is more formal than \"look like\".\n- The second input's output is more formal by using \"whom\" instead of \"I\".\n- The third input's output is entirely restructured for formality and politeness.\n- The fourth input's output replaces slang with a descriptive phrase.\n- The fifth input's output replaces informal phrasing with formal synonyms.\n\nThis could fit. But does \"formal and polite\" capture all these transformations? Let's see:\n\n- \"Looks like\" → \"resembles\": More formal.\n- \"I met\" → \"whom met\": More formal and possibly more polite.\n- \"Can you...\" → \"Would you...\": Polite and formal.\n- \"Fire\" → \"incredibly good\": Replaces slang with a description.\n- \"Whole story made up\" → \"Entire story fabricated\": Uses formal synonyms.\n\nSo if the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version, considering different contexts (like replacing slang, changing verb forms, restructuring questions, etc.), that could fit all the outputs. However, the first transformation is just changing \"look like\" to \"resemble\", which is a formality but not necessarily politeness. But maybe in this context, \"resemble\" is seen as more polite than \"look like\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate each input into a more formal register, which would require applying different rules depending on the phrase. For example:\n\n- Change \"look like\" to \"resemble\" for formality.\n- Replace \"I\" with \"whom\" to make it more formal and indirect.\n- Restructure the question \"Can you...\" into a more polite \"Would you be able to...\"\n- Replace slang with more formal expressions.\n- Use synonyms for informal terms (\"whole\" → \"entire\", \"made up\" → \"fabricated\").\n\nThis seems plausible. Therefore, the instruction was probably to convert each input into a more formal and polite version, applying different transformation rules based on the structure of each input.\n\nBut let's verify if there's a more precise instruction. For example, maybe the instruction was to use more formal vocabulary and punctuation. However, the first input's output doesn't change punctuation, the second input's output uses \"whom\" (but original had \"I\"), third input's output uses different punctuation (question mark to period?), fourth input's output uses a comma, fifth input's output uses the same punctuation. Hmm, the third input's output is a statement, but the original was a question. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the entire input into a more formal version, regardless of the original structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to rewrite each input using more formal language structures, such as:\n\n- Avoiding contractions (though the inputs don't use contractions).\n- Changing \"you\" to \"one\" or \"people\" (not happening here).\n- Using different verbs (as in the first transformation).\n- Restructuring questions into statements or more formal questions.\n\nBut the third input's output changes \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\", which is a different structure. The second input's output adds \"whom\", which is an object pronoun, replacing \"I\" (subject).\n\nAnother angle: The instruction might involve specific linguistic corrections. For example:\n\n1. Replace \"look like\" with \"resemble\" (noun + verb).\n2. Replace \"I\" with \"whom\" when followed by a past participle (met).\n3. Change \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\", adding \"be able to\".\n4. Replace \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\" (slang to descriptive phrase).\n5. Replace \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\" (synonym replacements).\n\nEach of these seems to target different aspects. But how can they all fit under one instruction? Perhaps the instruction was to make each input more formal and precise by applying these specific transformations, even though each requires a different approach. The friend, following the instruction, applied these various fixes based on the input's structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate each input into a more formal version, using specific substitutions. For example, replacing \"look like\" with \"resemble\", \"I\" with \"whom\", restructuring questions, replacing slang, and synonyms for informal terms. This would require the friend to recognize which transformation applies to each input.\n\nIn summary, the most plausible instruction seems to be: \"Convert each input into a more formal and precise version by replacing 'look like' with 'resemble', replacing 'I' with 'whom' when followed by a past participle, restructuring questions into more polite forms, replacing slang terms, and using synonyms for informal expressions like 'whole' and 'made up'.\"\n\nBut the problem states that the instruction was given once, and the friend applied it to all inputs. Therefore, the instruction must encompass all these steps. Another possibility is that the instruction was to \"politize and formalize the sentence,\" which includes all those transformations, but that's quite broad.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to use more formal English by replacing contractions, changing pronouns, etc. But the inputs don't have contractions. Wait, the second input's original uses \"I\", and the output uses \"whom\". That's a structural change. So perhaps the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" when it's followed by a past participle verb. Because in the original, \"I met\" becomes \"whom met\". That's a specific rule. Similarly, \"Can you...\" becomes \"Would you be able to...\", which is a general rephrasing rule. \n\nAnother thought: The instruction could be to apply specific transformations depending on the context. For example:\n\n- If the input contains \"look like\", replace with \"resemble\".\n- If the input contains \"I\" followed by a past participle, replace with \"whom\".\n- If the input is a question starting with \"Can you\", rephrase it as \"Would you be able to\".\n- If the input contains slang like \"fire\", replace with \"incredibly good\".\n- If the input has \"whole story made up\", replace with \"entire story fabricated\".\n\nBut this still implies multiple separate instructions. However, the problem states that there was one instruction. Therefore, the instruction must have covered all these possibilities under a single umbrella. \n\nPerhaps the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal version, and whenever applicable, replace informal elements. For example:\n\n\"Make each sentence more formal and precise. Replace contractions with full forms, avoid colloquial expressions, and use more formal synonyms where appropriate. Additionally, ensure proper grammatical structure, such as using 'whom' in place of 'I' when necessary, and rephrasing questions into more polite forms.\"\n\nBut this is still somewhat vague. However, considering the examples, the instruction likely involved a combination of:\n\n- Replacing \"look like\" with \"resemble\" (formalizing).\n- Changing \"I\" to \"whom\" when followed by a past participle (more formal and indirect).\n- Converting \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\" (politeness).\n- Replacing slang with more descriptive terms (e.g., \"fire\" to \"incredibly good\").\n- Synonym replacements for informal terms (e.g., \"whole\" to \"entire\", \"made up\" to \"fabricated\").\n\nGiven that all these transformations result in more formal and polite versions of the original inputs, it's reasonable to conclude that the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version, applying appropriate linguistic adjustments depending on the context.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **convert each input into a more formal and polite version**, applying specific linguistic adjustments based on context. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Replace \"look like\" with \"resemble\"**: Formalizes the comparison (e.g., \"She looks like her sister\" → \"She resembles her sister\").\n2. **Replace \"I\" with \"whom\" when followed by a past participle**: Adds formality and indirectness (e.g., \"I met yesterday\" → \"whom I met yesterday\").\n3. **Restructure \"Can you...\" into \"Would you be able to...\":** Polishes questions into a more polite and formal tone (e.g., \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\").\n4. **Replace slang with descriptive alternatives**: Clarifies informal expressions (e.g., \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\").\n5. **Synonym replacements**: Formalizes everyday terms (e.g., \"whole\" → \"entire,\" \"made up\" → \"fabricated\").\n\n**Final Instruction:**  \n\"Politize and formalize each input by replacing informal phrases, adjusting pronouns, restructuring questions, and using synonyms to enhance clarity and formality.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs where each input seems to have been transformed into an output using a specific rule or set of rules. My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction that would generate these outputs from the inputs.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the input-output pairs to see if there's a pattern or common transformation between them.\n\n1. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n2. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n3. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n4. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n5. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n\nLet me analyze each pair one by one to find possible transformations.\n\nStarting with the first pair: \"considered many approaches\" becomes \"various approaches were considered.\" So the subject changed from \"I\" to \"various,\" and the verb structure shifted. Original sentence uses present perfect passive? Wait, no. Let me parse both sentences.\n\nOriginal: \"I considered many approaches.\" (Active voice: Subject + past participle + direct object)\nOutput: \"Various approaches were considered.\" (Passive voice: Direct object + auxiliary verb + past participle; subject is now \"approaches\" but in passive, the subject is typically the object of the active sentence. Wait, maybe not. Wait, the original sentence is \"I considered...\" so the direct object is \"many approaches.\" In the output, it's \"various approaches were considered,\" which is passive voice where the subject is \"approaches,\" and the agent is implied as \"I\" since the original active voice is \"I considered...\" So perhaps the instruction is converting active voice sentences to passive voice. Let's check other examples.\n\nSecond input-output pair: \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Here, \"made up\" is a phrasal verb meaning invented, and the output uses \"fabricated,\" which is a synonym. So maybe the instruction is replacing certain phrases with synonyms, but only in specific contexts where the original is a phrasal verb. But wait, \"made up\" here is an adjective phrase modifying \"story,\" whereas \"fabricated\" is a verb form. Wait, the original sentence is \"was made up,\" which is passive voice. The output is \"was fabricated,\" also passive. So maybe the transformation is both replacing \"made up\" with \"fabricated\" and changing the passive voice structure? Let's check another example.\n\nThird input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, the input is an active sentence with a possessive pronoun (\"I\") before the verb. The output replaces \"I met\" with \"whom I met,\" changing the pronoun from subject to object case. Wait, but \"I met\" is in the past tense. The output is \"whom I met,\" using \"whom\" instead of \"I.\" However, \"whom\" is the objective case. So this might be a correction to use the correct pronoun case in the relative clause. The original is \"I met yesterday,\" which is okay, but when placed after \"lawyer,\" it should use \"whom\" because it's the object of the prepositional phrase \"whom I met.\" Wait, no, in the original input, the sentence is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, \"I met yesterday\" is part of the main clause, not a subordinate clause. The pronoun \"I\" is the subject of the verb \"met.\" So the original is correct. But the output changes \"I\" to \"whom.\" That seems odd unless there's a mistake in the original. Maybe the instruction is correcting the pronoun case in the relative clause. For example, if the input had \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful,\" then the output would be the same. But the input is \"I met,\" which is grammatically correct. Unless the original was supposed to have a subordinate clause, like \"The lawyer [that/who] I met yesterday was helpful,\" but written as \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" In standard English, \"I met\" is the predicate nominative, not part of a subordinate clause. Therefore, the pronoun \"I\" is correct. But the output uses \"whom,\" which is incorrect here. This might be a mistake, but assuming the instruction is applied correctly, perhaps the input had a different structure. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is about changing the possessive case in some way. Hmm, this is confusing. Let's move on.\n\nFourth input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" Here, \"looks like\" is replaced with \"resembles,\" which is a synonym. So similar to the second example, but not exactly passive voice. The original is active, and the output is also active. So perhaps the transformation here is replacing \"looks like\" with a synonym.\n\nFifth input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Again, \"can't stand\" is replaced with \"cannot tolerate,\" synonyms. So here, replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate.\" So the pattern here is replacing phrases with their synonyms. Let's see if this applies to all cases.\n\nSo far, the first example seems to involve passive voice conversion. Let's check:\n\nOriginal: Active voice (I considered many approaches). Output: Passive voice (Various approaches were considered). So the instruction might be converting active sentences to passive ones, replacing \"considered\" with \"were considered\" and changing the subject to the direct object (approaches) and the verb form.\n\nSecond example: \"was made up\" (passive) → \"was fabricated\" (passive), replacing \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\" So the instruction might also replace specific phrases with synonyms in passive voice constructions.\n\nThird example: Changing \"I\" to \"whom\" in a certain context. Wait, but in the original input, the pronoun is \"I,\" which is correct. However, the output uses \"whom,\" which is incorrect here. This seems like a mistake, unless the instruction is intended to do something else. Maybe the instruction is about changing possessive pronouns? Or maybe the friend made a mistake, but the user is presenting the outputs as correct. If we have to proceed under the assumption that the instruction is valid and the outputs are correct, perhaps there's another transformation here. Alternatively, maybe the third input was mistyped. For example, if the input was \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful,\" then the output would be the same. But given the input provided, this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third example is about converting the possessive pronoun from subject to object case in a different scenario. Wait, \"I met yesterday\" is part of the main clause. The pronoun \"I\" is correct here. The word \"whom\" would be used if \"I met\" were the object of a preposition, but here it's not. For example, if the input was \"The lawyer, whom I met yesterday, was helpful,\" then the output would keep \"whom.\" But the original input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful,\" where \"I met\" is the predicate. So the pronoun is correct as \"I.\" Unless the instruction is changing all instances of \"I\" to \"me,\" but that would be incorrect in this context. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to change \"I\" to \"who\" or \"whom\" in all cases, regardless of context. But that's not standard grammar. So perhaps this is an exception, but since the user provided these outputs as correct, maybe we need to accept it as part of the instruction's rule.\n\nFourth example: \"looks like\" → \"resembles.\" Synonym replacement.\n\nFifth example: \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate.\" Synonym replacement.\n\nSo putting this together, possible instruction components:\n\n1. Convert active voice to passive voice.\n   - Example 1: Active → Passive.\n   - Example 2: Passive remains passive, but a synonym is used.\n   - Example 4: Active → Active, but with synonym replacement. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, example 2: Input is passive (\"was made up\"), output is passive (\"was fabricated\"). So the transformation here is replacing \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\" So perhaps in passive voice constructions, replace certain verbs/phrases with synonyms. But in example 1, the active is converted to passive. So the instruction might be: if the sentence is in active voice, convert it to passive voice. If it's in passive voice, replace certain verbs with synonyms. But how does that apply to all cases?\n\nLooking at example 1: Input is active (I considered...), output is passive. So instruction converts active to passive.\n\nExample 2: Input is passive (\"was made up\"), output is passive (\"was fabricated\"), replacing \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\"\n\nExample 3: Input is active (\"I met...\"), output is changing \"I\" to \"whom.\" Wait, but that's not a voice change. So this seems conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the instruction is a combination of two things: sometimes converting active to passive, and sometimes replacing certain verbs/phrases in passive with synonyms.\n\nBut why the inconsistency? Let's think again.\n\nAnother approach: looking for common transformations that could apply across all examples.\n\nThe third example is tricky. Maybe the instruction is about changing the possessive pronoun from subject to object case in certain contexts. But in the input, it's \"I met,\" which is correct. The output uses \"whom,\" which is incorrect here unless there's a subordinate clause. But if the input was \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful,\" then the output would be same. But the original input is \"I met yesterday,\" which is the predicate. So perhaps the instruction is not applicable here. Alternatively, maybe the input was actually \"The lawyer that/who I met yesterday was helpful,\" but written without the relative pronoun. Then the output adds \"whom,\" but that's a different scenario. Hmm, this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is about making the sentence more formal or using a certain type of relative clause. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the third example might involve changing the reflexive pronoun. But \"I met\" has no reflexive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in certain contexts. But this isn't standard grammar. For example, \"I saw a man who met me yesterday\" vs. \"The man whom I met yesterday...\" So in the relative clause, \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met.\" But in the main clause, \"I met...\" is okay. The input here is the main clause, so changing \"I\" to \"whom\" would be incorrect. Unless the instruction is always changing \"I\" to \"whom,\" which is wrong except in certain cases. But this seems unlikely.\n\nGiven that the user's output for the third input is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful,\" which replaces \"I\" with \"whom,\" perhaps the instruction is to change all instances of \"I\" to \"whom\" in all contexts. But that's not grammatically correct. However, considering that the output is presented as correct by the user, maybe they consider this a valid transformation. Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third input was originally supposed to have a relative clause, and the instruction was to add \"whom\" there. For example, if the input was \"The lawyer that I met yesterday was helpful,\" the output would add \"whom.\" But the given input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful,\" which is a simple sentence. Without additional clauses, \"whom\" is not required. This suggests that either the input is incorrect, or the instruction is misapplied here. Since the user provided the outputs as correct, perhaps we need to accept this as part of the instruction's rule, even if it's not standard grammar.\n\nMoving on to the fourth example: \"She looks like her sister.\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" This is replacing \"looks like\" with a synonym. Similarly, fifth example: \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate.\" So these are synonym replacements for specific collocations.\n\nSo combining these observations:\n\nPossible instruction components:\n\n1. Convert active voice to passive voice, changing the subject to the direct object and adding \"were\" as auxiliary verb.\n2. Replace \"I considered...\" with \"various approaches were considered.\" This example shows that in the output, \"I\" becomes \"various,\" which is different from the passive voice conversion. Wait, in the first example, the output starts with \"Various approaches were considered,\" where the subject is the direct object (\"approaches\") and \"were considered\" is passive. The original was active, so this fits the voice conversion. So the first instruction is converting active to passive voice. Then the second example is passive → passive with synonym. Third example is active → changing \"I\" to \"whom,\" but this doesn't fit voice conversion. Fourth and fifth examples are replacing collocations with synonyms.\n\nThis seems contradictory. How can the same instruction cover all these cases?\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the instruction involves multiple steps or conditions. For example:\n\n- If the input contains a relative clause, replace \"I\" with \"who\" or \"whom.\"\n- If the input is a collocation like \"look like,\" replace with \"resemble.\"\n- If the input is a verb phrase like \"can't stand,\" replace with \"cannot tolerate.\"\n- If the input is an active voice sentence, convert to passive voice.\n\nBut how does this apply to all examples?\n\nFirst example: Active → Passive. Second example: Passive → Passive with synonym. Third example: Active → Passive conversion but with \"whom\" added. Fourth and fifth: Synonyms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to convert active to passive whenever possible, but when not possible, replace certain phrases with synonyms. However, the third example doesn't fit either category unless there's another condition.\n\nAlternatively, the third example might involve changing possessive pronouns. For example, \"I met\" is part of the main clause, so changing \"I\" to \"who\" or \"whom\" might be considered a correction to the relative clause, but in the given input, it's not a relative clause. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third example is about changing the possessive pronoun from subject to object case. Wait, \"I met\" is in the predicate, not the object. The object of \"met\" would be the direct object, but here, there's no direct object. So perhaps the instruction is not applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third example is a typo or error in the input, but the user included it as part of the instruction's test cases. However, since we need to reverse-engineer the instruction based on the given pairs, we can't assume errors in the inputs.\n\nGiven the inconsistency in the third example, perhaps the instruction is not uniformly applicable. Let's re-examine all examples again.\n\nFirst example:\nActive → Passive.\n\nSecond example:\nPassive → Passive with synonym.\n\nThird example:\nActive → Passive conversion plus changing \"I\" to \"whom.\" But this introduces an element unrelated to voice.\n\nFourth example:\nActive → Passive conversion with synonym substitution.\n\nWait, but fourth example input is active (\"She looks...\"), output is passive (\"She was resembled...\"? No, the output is \"She resembles her sister,\" which is active. Wait, no, the output is \"She resembles her sister,\" which is active. So that contradicts the passive voice conversion idea.\n\nHold on, the fourth example:\n\nInput: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" So active → active, with \"looks like\" replaced by \"resembles.\"\n\nSimilarly, fifth example: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Active → active, \"can't stand\" replaced by \"cannot tolerate.\"\n\nSo examples 1, 2, 4, 5 involve voice changes (active to passive), while example 3 involves changing \"I\" to \"whom\" (which is voice-neutral but changes pronoun case) and possibly synonym replacement (if \"I met\" is part of a relative clause). Wait, in example 3, the output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" If the input was \"The lawyer that/who I met yesterday was helpful,\" then the output would be the same. But the input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful,\" which is a simple sentence. So why change \"I\" to \"whom\"? Unless the instruction is always replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" regardless of context. That would be incorrect, but perhaps the user considers it a valid transformation for this purpose. However, that's non-standard grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to correct the pronoun case in a relative clause. For example, if the input had a relative clause like \"The lawyer, who I met yesterday, was helpful,\" then changing \"who\" to \"whom\" would be incorrect. But if the input was \"The lawyer that I met yesterday was helpful,\" then changing \"I\" to \"whom\" would be wrong. This doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert any instance of \"I\" to \"whom\" in all cases. But this is not standard grammar. For example, \"I saw him\" becomes \"whom saw him,\" which is incorrect. So this is not a valid transformation. Hence, the third example must be an exception or there's a misunderstanding.\n\nGiven that all other examples involve either passive voice conversion or synonym replacement, perhaps the third example is a mistake in the input. However, since the user provided all five examples, we must work with them as given.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the third example is a case of changing the possessive pronoun from subject to object case in a different context. For example, if \"I met\" were part of a relative clause, like \"The lawyer, whom I met yesterday, was helpful,\" then changing \"whom\" to \"I\" would be incorrect, but changing \"met\" to \"met\" is fine. But in the input, it's a simple sentence without such a clause. So this line of reasoning doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third example is an instance where the instruction requires changing the possessive pronoun from subject to object case. For example, \"my dog\" becomes \"his dog.\" But in the input, the possessive is \"her sister.\" The output is \"resembles her sister.\" So the possessive pronoun isn't directly involved here. Unless the instruction is replacing \"sister\" with a synonym, but that doesn't fit the third example's output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to replace \"sister\" with \"sibling\" or \"relative,\" but that's not the case here. The output uses \"sister\" as well.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let's compile all possible transformations observed:\n\n1. Passive voice conversion (examples 1, 2).\n2. Synonym replacement for collocations (\"look like\" → \"resemble,\" \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\") (examples 4, 5).\n3. Pronoun case change (\"I\" → \"whom\")",

Hmm, each input seems to have been transformed into a slightly different version. Let me look at each example carefully.\n\nFirst pair: Input is \"I considered many approaches.\" Output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" So here, the subject \"I\" became \"Various\", and \"considered many approaches\" remained similar but in passive voice. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentence using more formal language or changing the perspective.\n\nSecond input: \"This song is fire.\" Output is \"This song is incredibly good.\" Oh, \"fire\" is slang for great, so the output uses a more standard adjective \"incredibly good\". So maybe the instruction was to replace informal expressions with standard phrasing.\n\nThird input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Output is \"Shall I accompany you?\" The original is a question asking if they should go together. The output is a more formal \"shall I\" which is a polite suggestion. Maybe the instruction was to convert questions into polite requests, or rephrase in a more formal tone.\n\nFourth input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, \"whom\" replaces \"I\". So the instruction might be to use relative pronouns (whom instead of who) where appropriate, especially after prepositions. Wait, in the original sentence, \"I met\" the lawyer, so \"whom\" is correct. So maybe the instruction was to rewrite the sentence with the correct relative pronoun when it follows a preposition like \"after whom\".\n\nFifth input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" The original uses \"can't tell the difference\" which is colloquial. The output uses more formal phrasing \"find it hard to distinguish\". So similar to the second example, replacing informal expressions with standard terms.\n\nPutting all these transformations together: Each input seems to be being converted into a more formal or grammatically correct version. Let's check each element:\n\n1. Changing \"I considered\" to \"Various approaches were considered\" - formalizing and maybe generalizing (\"many\" becomes \"various\").\n2. Replacing slang \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\".\n3. Converting a yes/no question into a polite \"shall I\" suggestion.\n4. Changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" to use the correct relative pronoun.\n5. \"Can't tell the difference\" to \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n\nSo possible instruction: The task was to rephrase each input sentence into a more formal version, possibly using more precise grammar structures, eliminating contractions, replacing informal expressions with standard vocabulary, and adjusting sentence structure where necessary (like using \"whom\" instead of \"who\").\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the instruction required converting first-person singular into third person, but the first example doesn't do that. Alternatively, changing the verb tense? No, tenses remain the same.\n\nLooking at the outputs, the second example replaces \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\". Similarly, the fifth replaces \"can't tell\" with \"find... hard to distinguish\". So it's about standardizing language rather than changing the meaning.\n\nThird example changes \"do you want me to go with you\" into \"shall I accompany you\". That's a direct transformation from a question seeking permission to a polite request, perhaps using \"shall\" which is more formal.\n\nFourth example uses \"whom\" correctly instead of \"who\". So the instruction might involve correcting relative pronoun usage, especially when the relative clause follows a preposition.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction likely asked the friend to rewrite each input into a more formal or grammatically correct version, possibly using more precise vocabulary, proper punctuation, avoiding contractions, adjusting pronoun use (like \"whom\"), and replacing informal expressions with standard phrasing.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input sentence into a more formal or grammatically correct version** by:\n1. **Replacing informal expressions** (e.g., \"fire → incredibly good\", \"can’t tell → find hard to distinguish\").\n2. **Using more precise grammar**: \n   - Convert contractions (e.g., \"Do you → Shall I\").\n   - Correct relative pronouns (e.g., \"I met → whom I met\").\n3. **Adjusting sentence structure** (e.g., removing first-person references via generalization, formalizing suggestions). \n\nThe goal was to eliminate colloquialisms, enhance clarity, and adhere to standard English conventions.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

Hmm, looking at each example, there seems to be a pattern where the output is modifying or restructuring the input in some way. Let me start by analyzing each pair one by one.\n\nFirst input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output is \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" So here, \"can't stand\" is replaced with \"cannot tolerate.\" Maybe the instruction is to replace certain phrases with their synonyms? But then why not all? Like \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated,\" which is a synonym too. Wait, \"fabricated\" is more formal than \"made up,\" maybe converting informal expressions to more formal ones?\n\nLooking at the third input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" So here, the structure is changing from a question using \"want\" to a question starting with \"shall,\" and changing the phrasing from \"go with you\" to \"accompany you.\" That seems like transforming questions into suggestions, perhaps using formal language or different structures.\n\nFourth input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" Oh, this is a big transformation. The original is a statement expressing an opinion, but the output is converting it into a passive voice suggestion using \"it is suggested.\" So maybe the instruction was to rephrase statements into recommendations or suggestions, possibly using more formal language.\n\nFifth input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, they replaced \"I met\" with \"whom I met,\" adding the relative pronoun \"whom.\" So changing the possessive pronoun to an object pronoun with \"whom,\" which might be about formal vs. informal grammar usage.\n\nPutting this together, the instruction might be to convert the input sentences into more formal, structured versions. Let's see:\n\n1. Replace contractions (like \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\") to make the language more formal.\n2. Convert questions from \"do you want...\" to \"shall I...\" to make them sound more like polite requests or formal suggestions.\n3. Change the structure of the sentence to present passive voice or recommendations (\"It is suggested...\").\n4. Use more formal pronouns, like replacing \"whom\" instead of \"I met,\" which is more formal.\n\nWait, but in the first example, \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\" is replacing a phrase with a synonym. Then the third example is transforming a question into a suggestion. The fourth is changing the whole sentence structure into a passive voice recommendation. The fifth is about pronoun usage. So maybe the instruction is a combination of these transformations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the inputs into more formal or standard English, avoiding contractions, changing verb tenses, improving grammar (like replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met\"), and restructuring sentences into recommendations or passive constructions.\n\nAnother angle: the outputs seem to be using more formal vocabulary and structures. For example, \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up,\" \"accompany\" instead of \"go with,\" \"suggested\" instead of \"think,\" \"whom\" instead of \"I met.\"\n\nSo the instruction could be: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal version by replacing informal phrases, contractions, and colloquial expressions with their more formal equivalents, restructuring sentences where necessary, and ensuring grammatical correctness.\"\n\nBut wait, let's check if that fits all examples. For instance, the fourth input is converted into a suggestion using \"It is suggested that,\" which is a formal way to present advice. The third input changes \"Do you want...\" to \"Shall I...\" which is a more formal and indirect way to ask for permission or agreement.\n\nIn the fifth example, replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met\" uses \"whom\" instead of the simpler \"I met him/her,\" making it more formal. Similarly, in the first input, \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate,\" which is more formal.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the instruction is likely: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal version by replacing contractions with their full forms, adjusting verb tenses or structures where appropriate, and improving clarity or formality.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might be more specific, like \"Convert each input into a passive voice sentence using 'it is suggested' when expressing an opinion,\" but that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nWait, looking back at the fourth example, the original is a statement, and the output is a suggestion phrased as \"It is suggested that...\" So maybe the instruction was to turn statements into recommendations or suggestions, often phrased formally. The third example transforms a question into such a suggestion. The fourth does the same. So perhaps the instruction was to take any sentence and rephrase it as a formal suggestion or recommendation, possibly using \"It is suggested that...\" when appropriate.\n\nBut the fifth example is about pronoun usage. So maybe the instruction had multiple parts: adjust contractions, change questions to suggestions, use formal pronouns, and restructure sentences into recommendations.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to translate each input into a more formal register, which encompasses all those changes. So the instruction is: \"Refine each input into a more formal register by eliminating contractions, replacing informal expressions with more formal equivalents, restructuring sentences to enhance clarity and formality, and using appropriate grammatical constructs such as passives, subjunctives, or recommendations.\"\n\nYes, that seems to cover all the examples. For instance:\n\n- Input 1: Contractions eliminated (can't → cannot), informal expression \"can't stand\" replaced with \"cannot tolerate.\"\n- Input 3: Question changed to a suggestion (\"shall I accompany\") with formal phrasing.\n- Input 4: Statement converted into a recommendation using \"it is suggested.\"\n- Input 5: Informal possessive \"I met\" replaced with formal \"whom I met.\"\n- Input 2: \"made up\" → \"fabricated\" for more formality.\n\nSo the instruction would be asking the assistant to rephrase each input into a more formal, professional, or academic tone, adjusting vocabulary, sentence structure, and grammar as needed.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided was to **rephrase each input into a more formal register** by employing the following transformations:\n1. **Eliminate contractions**: Replace \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate,\" etc.\n2. **Adjust verb phrases**: Use more formal alternatives like \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up.\"\n3. **Restructure sentences**:\n   - Transform questions (\"Do you want...\") into polite requests (\"Shall I...\").\n   - Rewrite statements into recommendations (\"It is suggested...\").\n4. **Improve grammatical correctness**:\n   - Replace informal pronouns (\"I met\") with formal constructions (\"whom I met\").\n\nThis systematic approach aimed to elevate the language’s formality, clarity, and adherence to standard grammar.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The friend took five different inputs and produced outputs that seem to be rephrasing them in a more formal or polite way. Let's start by looking at each pair to see if there's a pattern.\n\nFirst, let's list the input-output pairs again:\n\n1. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n2. Input: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n3. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n4. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n5. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n\nHmm, so each output seems to be a more formal or less direct version of the input. Let's break down each transformation.\n\nStarting with the first example: the original is a question asking for permission to go along. The output uses \"Shall I\" which is a more polite request, replacing \"do you want me...\" with a first-person \"I\". So maybe the instruction was to rephrase questions into polite suggestions or formal statements.\n\nSecond input: The original is an informal farewell, \"See you.\" The output becomes \"I look forward to meeting you,\" which is more polite and anticipatory. So replacing casual phrases with expressions of looking forward.\n\nThird input: The original is \"I think...\" which is a statement of opinion. The output changes it to \"It is my opinion...\" making it sound more formal or structured. So perhaps converting first-person statements into third-person statements with more qualifiers like \"my opinion\" or \"in my view\".\n\nFourth input: \"Thanks for your help.\" is a simple expression of gratitude. The output turns it into \"Your assistance is much appreciated,\" which is more formal and emphasizes the value of the help given.\n\nFifth input: \"She looks like her sister.\" becomes \"She resembles her sister.\" Here, the verb \"resembles\" is a synonym for \"looks like\" but is more formal. So replacing synonyms with more formal words.\n\nPutting all these transformations together, the instruction might be something like: \"Convert the given input into a more formal or polite version of the statement by replacing informal expressions with their more formal counterparts, rephrasing sentences where necessary, and using more polite phrasing where applicable.\"\n\nWait, but looking at all the examples, they each follow a specific kind of transformation rather than a general guideline. For instance, the first example turns a question into a suggestion, the second an informal greeting into a formal one, the third a first-person statement into a third-person with \"opinion\", fourth thanks into more formal gratitude, fifth a synonym substitution.\n\nIs there a common thread here? Maybe each example involves replacing certain words or structures with more formal or indirect equivalents. Let's check:\n\n- Question → Suggestion (first input)\n- Greeting → Formal acknowledgment (second)\n- First-person opinion → Third-person opinion (third)\n- Gratitude → More formal expression (fourth)\n- Similarity expression → More precise synonym (fifth)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal tone, using different phrasing techniques each time. But the examples vary widely. Another angle: maybe the instruction was about transforming each sentence into a passive voice or using \"I\" instead of \"you\", but let's see:\n\nFirst input: \"Do you...\" becomes \"Shall I...\". No passive here. Second input: \"See you...\" becomes \"I look forward to...\". So \"you\" is replaced with \"me\" in the first case. Third input: \"I think...\" becomes \"It is my opinion...\", so changing subject from \"I\" to \"it\". Fourth input: \"Thanks for...\" becomes \"Your assistance is...\", so changing \"your\" to possessive adjective. Fifth input: \"She looks like...\" becomes \"She resembles...\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a more formal version by using more complex sentence structures or polite language. However, looking at all examples, the transformations are quite varied. Let's think if there's a common rule.\n\nLooking at the outputs, sometimes they are rephrased using \"I\", \"my\", \"you\", \"assistance\", \"much\", \"resemble\" etc. But perhaps the underlying rule is to turn each input into a more formal, polite, or structured version. For example:\n\n1. Change from a question into a polite suggestion (using \"shall I accompany\" instead of \"do you want me\").\n2. Change from a casual greeting (\"see you\") to a formal anticipation of meeting (\"look forward to meeting you\").\n3. Change \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\" to sound more professional.\n4. Change \"thanks for your help\" to \"your assistance is much appreciated\" to be more formal and emphasize the value.\n5. Replace \"looks like\" with \"resembles\" to use a synonym that's more formal.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or structured version by:\n\n- Using more formal verbs and phrases (like \"accompany\" instead of \"go with\", \"look forward to\" instead of \"see you\")\n- Converting first-person pronouns to more formal ones or using third-person (\"my opinion\", \"your assistance\")\n- Replacing informal expressions with more elevated or precise terms (e.g., \"resembles\" instead of \"looks like\")\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they each start with \"I\" except the first output. Wait no, the first output is \"Shall I accompany you?\" which starts with \"Shall\". So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to turn each input into a response that is more formal or polite by using different wording, regardless of the structure. For example, transforming each input into a more formal equivalent. Let's check each input-output again:\n\nInput 1: Question → Suggestion (polite request)\nInput 2: Casual greeting → Formal acknowledgment\nInput 3: Opinion expressed as \"I think\" → Structured opinion\nInput 4: Gratitude → Formal thanks\nInput 5: Descriptive similarity → Precise synonym\n\nSo each input requires a different kind of transformation, but all aiming towards formality and politeness. The instruction could be something like: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal or polite version of the statement by rephrasing in a more structured or elevated manner, using appropriate vocabulary and tone.\"\n\nBut perhaps the instruction was more specific, like: \"Convert each sentence into its more formal equivalent by replacing certain keywords and restructuring the sentence.\" For example, replacing \"do you\" with \"shall I\", changing \"thanks\" to \"much appreciated\", etc.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to use a specific method, like turning each sentence into a subordinate clause introduced by \"it is my opinion that\", but that only applies to the third input. Hmm.\n\nWait, the third input's output is \"It is my opinion that this is interesting,\" which uses \"my opinion\" after \"it is\". This is a structure where the main clause is \"it is\" followed by a subordinate clause starting with \"my opinion\". Similarly, the first output is a question starting with \"Shall I\". So maybe the instruction was to convert the input into such a structure, but the others don't fit that.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to take each input and rephrase it into a more formal, possibly inverted or indirect structure, maintaining the original meaning but using more formal language.\n\nGiven that the outputs are all rephrased in a more formal tone with various methods—rephrasing questions into suggestions, changing greetings into formal responses, converting first-person opinions into third-person with \"my opinion\", turning gratitude into more elaborate expressions of thanks, and replacing \"looks like\" with \"resembles\"—the instruction likely was to transform each input into a more formal or polite version by using more elevated vocabulary and restructuring the sentence as needed.\n\nTherefore, the instruction probably was something along the lines of: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version by replacing informal expressions with their more refined equivalents, adjusting the sentence structure where necessary to maintain clarity and proper formality.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was: **\"Rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version by replacing informal expressions with their more refined equivalents, adjusting the sentence structure where necessary to maintain clarity and proper formality.\"**\n\nThis instruction required transforming each input into a more structured, elevated, and courteous version. Below are the key transformations applied to each input-output pair:\n\n1. **Question → Suggestion**:  \n   - Input: *Do you want me to go with you?*  \n   - Output: *Shall I accompany you?*  \n   *Revised phrasing removes ambiguity and uses a polite offer.*\n\n2. **Casual Greeting → Formal Acknowledgment**:  \n   - Input: *See you tonight.*  \n   - Output: *I look forward to meeting you tonight.*  \n   *Substitutes informal “see you” with a deliberate anticipation of interaction.*\n\n3. **First-Person Opinion → Structured Statement**:  \n   - Input: *I think that this is interesting.*  \n   - Output: *It is my opinion that this is interesting.*  \n   *Rephrases \"I think\" into a formal, third-person perspective with \"my opinion.\"*\n\n4. **Gratitude → Elaborate Expression of Thanks**:  \n   - Input: *Thanks for your help.*  \n   - Output: *Your assistance is much appreciated.*  \n   *Replaces generic “thanks” with a nuanced expression emphasizing the value received.*\n\n5. **Descriptive Similarity → Precise Synonym**:  \n   - Input: *She looks like her sister.*  \n   - Output: *She resembles her sister.*  \n   *Swaps the colloquial \"looks like\" with the more formal \"resembles.\"*\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nThe instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version by refining vocabulary, restructuring sentences, and employing courteous language. The outputs demonstrate transformations that enhance formality and politeness through varied linguistic adjustments.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs where each output is a slightly adjusted version of the input. Let me start by analyzing each pair to see if there's a pattern or transformation rule that connects them.\n\nFirst, looking at the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\nHmm, both mean the same thing but use different words. \"Whole\" vs. \"entire,\" \"made up\" vs. \"fabricated.\" So maybe the instruction was to convert common expressions into their more formal equivalents. Like replacing colloquial terms with more sophisticated ones. For example, \"whole\" to \"entire,\" \"made up\" (meaning invented) to \"fabricated.\"\n\nSecond pair: \"I considered many approaches.\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\"\nHere, \"many\" becomes \"various,\" which is another synonym. Also, \"were considered\" is the passive voice. Wait, but the original is active (\"I considered...\"), and the output is passive? Or maybe it's not about changing voice but adjusting phrasing. Let me check other pairs.\n\nThird pair: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\nSo \"can't tell\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish.\" Both express difficulty in discerning something. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase expressions of inability to see differences into more formal or precise language.\n\nFourth pair: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\nHere, \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate.\" So similar meaning but using different verbs. Maybe the instruction involves converting informal expressions of disapproval into more formal terms. Other examples might include changing \"can't stand\" to \"cannot endure\" or \"find objectionable,\" but here it's just \"tolerate.\"\n\nFifth pair: \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\nIn this case, the output is more polite and anticipatory. \"See you\" is casual, and the output is a positive expectation. So perhaps the instruction was to turn casual greetings into more formal or polite phrases expressing anticipation rather than just confirmation.\n\nNow, trying to find a common thread across all these transformations. Let's list the possible categories:\n\n1. Formalizing language: Using more formal synonyms (e.g., \"whole\"→\"entire,\" \"considered\" remains same? Wait, in the second input, \"considered\" becomes passive voice but word remains same. Wait, the second input is active voice, output is passive. Hmm, that's different. Wait the second input is active: \"I considered,\" output is passive: \"were considered.\" Wait no, the output is \"Various approaches were considered,\" which is passive. So maybe changing from active to passive voice? But only the second input did that. Let's check again.\n\nWait, the second input was \"I considered many approaches.\" The output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" So the subject changes from \"I\" to \"approaches,\" and the verb becomes passive. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentence in passive voice? But then why does the third input not change to passive? Wait the third input is \"I can't tell the difference...\" and output is \"I find it hard...\" which is not passive. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to convert certain phrases into more formal equivalents without changing the sentence structure. Let's see:\n\nFirst pair: \"whole\" → \"entire,\" \"made up\" → \"fabricated.\" So replacing some words with more formal ones.\n\nSecond pair: \"many\" → \"various,\" and \"considered\" remains same but maybe the structure changes to passive. Wait, in the second output, the structure is passive: \"were considered.\" But the original is active. So perhaps the instruction is to rewrite the sentence in passive voice when possible. But then the third input is in present tense active, and the output is also present active. So that doesn't fit. Unless in some cases, like the second input, it's changed to passive, others not. But the fourth and fifth inputs didn't get passive.\n\nThird pair: \"can't tell\" → \"find it hard.\" So rephrasing idiomatic expressions into more formal phrasing.\n\nFourth pair: \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate.\" Changing the exact wording.\n\nFifth pair: \"See you\" → \"look forward to meeting you.\" Turning a casual greeting into a more formal anticipation.\n\nHmm, so different types of transformations. Maybe the instruction isn't a single rule but a set of possible rules. But the user mentioned giving an instruction and five inputs, and the friend applied the same instruction to each input, producing outputs. So perhaps the instruction is a set of specific tasks, such as replacing certain words with their formal counterparts, changing phrasing, etc.\n\nLooking at the first pair, replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\" The second pair replaces \"many\" with \"various.\" Third pair replaces \"can't tell\" with \"find it hard to distinguish.\" Fourth pair replaces \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate.\" Fifth pair transforms \"See you...\" into a more formal greeting.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to take each input and replace certain words or phrases with their more formal equivalents. But the exact criteria aren't clear. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert informal expressions into their more polite or standard forms. For example, \"made up\" (as in invented) to \"fabricated,\" which is more formal. Similarly, \"can't tell\" to \"find it hard to distinguish.\" \"Can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate.\" \"See you\" to \"look forward to meeting you.\"\n\nAnother angle: looking for patterns in the outputs. For instance, in the first input, \"made up\" is replaced with \"fabricated,\" which is a more legalistic term. In the third input, \"can't tell\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish,\" which is more precise. The fifth input is turning a casual \"see you\" into a more anticipatory phrase.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to turn each sentence into its passive voice counterpart. But the second input is passive, and the first is active. So that doesn't fit. Third input is active, output active. Fourth input is active, output passive? Wait, fourth input: original is \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" So same structure, just replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate.\" So maybe not passive. Fifth input: \"See you tonight\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" So changing from a simple greeting to a more elaborate statement expressing anticipation.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to convert each input into a more formal, polite response. Let's see:\n\n- First input: \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated\" (more formal). \"the whole story\" → \"the entire story.\" So both words are replaced with more formal terms.\n\n- Second input: \"many approaches\" → \"various approaches.\" \"considered\" remains same, but maybe changing from active to passive. Wait, no, the output is \"were considered,\" making it passive. Wait, the original is \"I considered,\" output is \"were considered.\" So changing from active to passive? But then third input is \"I can't tell the difference...\" which becomes \"I find it hard to distinguish...\" which is still active. So inconsistent. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more polite or professional version. For example, replacing \"can't tell\" with \"have difficulty distinguishing,\" but that doesn't match the third output. Wait the third output is \"I find it hard to distinguish,\" which is different. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rewrite each input as a more formal alternative, possibly using synonyms or rephrasing. Let's see:\n\nFirst input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n\nSecond input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n\nThird input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n\nFourth input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n\nFifth input: \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n\nLooking at these transformations, it seems like each input is being adjusted in a way that makes the statement more formal or polite. For example:\n\n- Replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\" (more formal), \"made up\" with \"fabricated\" (more technical/legal).\n\n- Changing \"considered\" from active to passive (\"were considered\") but that doesn't fit all cases.\n\n- \"Can't tell\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\" — moving from an expression of inability to recognize something to a more formal phrasing of difficulty distinguishing.\n\n- \"Can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" — replacing the exact phrase with a synonym.\n\n- \"See you\" → \"look forward to meeting you\" — transforming a casual greeting into a more positive, anticipatory statement.\n\nSo, the instruction might be to transform each input into a more formal, polite, or precise version, possibly through synonym replacement, phrasing adjustments, or reorganizing sentence structure. The key is that each output is a refinement or upgrade of the original input's phrasing.\n\nBut how to generalize this into a single instruction? The user could have said something like, \"Refine each sentence into a more formal and polite version, using appropriate synonyms and rephrasing as needed.\" Or \"Polish each input into a more elegant and accurate expression, maintaining the original meaning but using more elevated language.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into its passive voice equivalent where applicable. But in the first input, the output isn't passive. So that might not be it. Alternatively, the instruction could be to convert each input into a more formal version by replacing informal expressions with their more standard equivalents.\n\nAnother angle: looking for common elements in the outputs. All outputs seem to either:\n\n1. Use more formal vocabulary (e.g., \"entire\" instead of \"whole\", \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up\").\n\n2. Rephrase idiomatic expressions into more precise or formal terms (e.g., \"can't tell\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\").\n\n3. Change the perspective from first person (\"I\") to a neutral or third-person perspective (e.g., \"were considered\" instead of \"I considered\").\n\n4. Anticipate a more polite or formal response (e.g., \"look forward to\" instead of \"see you\").\n\nBut the third input's output (\"were considered\") doesn't fit this pattern. So maybe that's not part of the instruction. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction was to convert each sentence into its passive voice form whenever possible, but that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to transform each input into a more formal, academic style, possibly through synonym substitution and rephrasing. For example, using \"various\" instead of \"many,\" \"entire\" instead of \"whole,\" \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up,\" etc.\n\nPutting this together, the most plausible instruction is likely something like:\n\n\"Refine each sentence into a more formal and precise version by replacing informal expressions with their more standard or academic equivalents, ensuring clarity and correctness in the communication.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been more specific, such as converting informal greetings into more polite statements expressing anticipation, or replacing certain phrasal verbs with their more formal counterparts.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the inverse process. What would you do to change the output back to the input? For example, \"The entire story was fabricated.\" → \"The whole story was made up.\" So replacing \"entire\" with \"whole,\" \"fabricated\" with \"made up.\" So maybe the instruction was to replace certain formal words with their informal counterparts. But that doesn't align with the other outputs. Wait, the second input's output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" If we reverse it, the input would be \"Many approaches were considered.\" But the original input was \"I considered many approaches.\" So the reverse might not make sense unless the instruction was to adjust the sentence structure differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a more formal version by adding qualifiers or rephrasing, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to transform each input into its passive voice counterpart. However, the first input's output isn't passive. The second input is passive, third is active, fourth is passive, fifth is active. So that doesn't hold.\n\nWait, in the second input, \"I considered\" becomes \"were considered.\" So subject changes from \"I\" to \"approaches,\" verb becomes passive. So perhaps the instruction was to rewrite the sentence in passive voice when the subject is not \"I\" but a noun. But this is inconsistent because the fifth input's output is \"I look forward...\" which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to change \"I\" to third person or plural, but that's speculative.\n\nGiven that the outputs vary in structure and word choice, the instruction is probably broader: to refine each input into a more formal, precise, and polite version, possibly through synonym replacement, rephrasing, or restructuring. The exact instruction might be phrased as:\n\n\"Take each input and rephrase it into a more formal and polished sentence, using appropriate synonyms, adjusting phrasing for clarity, and ensuring proper grammar and etiquette.\"\n\nTo confirm, looking at all pairs:\n\n1. \"The whole story...\" → \"The entire story...\" (formal replacement).\n2. \"I considered...\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" (changed subject to \"approaches,\" passive voice, replaced \"considered\" with \"were considered\"? Wait, no. Original is \"I considered many approaches.\" Output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" So subject changed from \"I\" to \"approaches,\" and the verb is passive. So changing from active to passive and changing \"considered\" to \"were considered\"? No, \"considered\" becomes \"were considered.\" So maybe the instruction was to make the subject the action performed, changing from \"I did X\" to \"X was done by me,\" but that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nThird pair: \"I can't tell...\" → \"I find it hard...\" (rephrasing difficulty in distinguishing).\n\nFourth: \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" (synonym replacement).\n\nFifth: \"See you...\" → \"look forward to...\" (changing greeting into anticipation).\n\nSo the instruction must cover multiple types of transformations: replacing informal words with formal, adjusting phrasing, changing perspective, rephrasing difficult-to-express ideas into clearer terms, etc. Hence, the instruction is likely to instruct the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal, precise, and polite version, using appropriate language conventions.\n\nTherefore, the instruction the user gave was something along the lines of:\n\n\"Refine each sentence into a more formal and precise version by replacing informal expressions with their more standard equivalents, ensuring clarity and correctness in the communication.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction the user gave to their friend was to **refine each input into a more formal and precise version**. This involved transforming the inputs by:\n\n1. **Replacing informal terms with formal alternatives** (e.g., \"whole\" → \"entire,\" \"made up\" → \"fabricated\").\n2. **Rephrasing idiomatic expressions** for clarity (e.g., \"can't tell\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\").\n3. **Adjusting sentence structure** to enhance formality or politeness (e.g., \"were considered\" replacing \"I considered\" in the second input).\n4. **Anticipating polite responses** (e.g., converting \"See you\" into \"I look forward to meeting you\").\n\nThe overarching goal was to produce outputs that are more **precise, formal, and courteous**, while preserving the original meaning. \n\n**Example Instructions**:  \n\"Polish each sentence into a more elegant and accurate expression by replacing colloquialisms with standard terms, rephrasing for clarity, and adapting tone for formality.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The friend received an input and produced these outputs. Let me look at each pair to see if I can spot a pattern or rule.\n\nStarting with the first input-output pair: Input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So here, the original sentence doesn't have a relative pronoun, but the output adds \"whom\" after \"lawyer.\" Hmm, but wait, in English, after \"the lawyer,\" using \"whom\" might be more formal. But maybe the instruction was to add a relative pronoun like \"who\" or \"whom\" based on context?\n\nWait, let's check the next one. Second input: \"Please call once you get there.\" Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\" So the instruction here might be to replace the phrase \"once you get there\" with a more formal expression like \"upon your arrival.\"\n\nThird input: \"Thanks for your help.\" Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" That seems like a more polite way of expressing thanks. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase gratitude into something more formal or structured.\n\nFourth input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" Here, the output changes the perspective from first person (\"I think\") to second person (\"my opinion\"), which sounds more like a standard statement. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase opinions into a more formal tone, using \"it is my opinion\" instead of \"I think.\"\n\nFifth input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" So here, the output changes \"whole\" (which is part of the noun) to \"entire\" and replaces \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\" So maybe the instruction was to use more formal vocabulary when possible, replacing common phrases with their more formal equivalents.\n\nPutting all these together: Let's see the common thread. Each output seems to be a more formal version of the input. For example, the second input uses \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"once you get there.\" The third input uses \"Your assistance...\" instead of direct thanks. The fourth input changes \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion.\" The fifth changes \"made up\" to \"fabricated.\" The first input adds \"whom,\" which is more formal. \n\nSo the instruction could be to make the sentences more formal or academic. Alternatively, maybe it's about grammatical correction. Let's check again.\n\nFirst input: adding \"whom\" – maybe the instruction was to use a relative clause correctly. In informal speech, people might omit \"whom,\" but in formal writing, it's needed. So the instruction could be to add the appropriate relative pronoun (like \"whom\") where necessary. But looking at the second output, replacing \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\" is more about vocabulary choice than grammar. Third output is a complete rephrasing of the gratitude. Fourth is changing perspective. Fifth is replacing colloquial terms with more formal ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version. For example, replacing contractions, changing the sentence structure, or using more elevated language.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they all seem to be more polite or formal. For instance, \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" is more formal than \"Thanks for your help.\" Similarly, \"It is my opinion\" is a more formal way to express an opinion than \"I think.\" The addition of \"entire\" instead of \"whole\" could be part of using more precise adjectives. \"Fabricated\" is a synonym but perhaps more formal than \"made up.\"\n\nSo combining these observations: The instruction likely required converting the input sentences into more formal versions. This would involve several aspects:\n1. Changing informal expressions to more formal ones (e.g., \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"once you get there\").\n2. Rewriting gratitude in a more formal manner (using \"Your assistance...\" rather than direct thanks).\n3. Restructuring opinions to use a more formal phrasing (\"It is my opinion...\").\n4. Replacing colloquial terms with more formal synonyms (e.g., \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up\").\n5. Adding relative pronouns like \"whom\" where appropriate for formality.\n\nAnother possibility is that the instruction was to make the sentences more grammatically correct, especially in cases like the first input, where adding \"whom\" corrects the relative clause. However, the other examples don't strictly involve grammar correction. For example, the second input's output uses a different prepositional phrase but not necessarily correcting grammar. Similarly, the third input is a complete rephrasing of the original, which might not be grammatically incorrect.\n\nSo, considering all examples, the most plausible instruction is to convert the input sentences into more formal, polite, or structured versions. This would involve adjusting vocabulary, sentence structure, and tone to meet a higher formality level. For instance, using more formal greetings, restructuring opinions, replacing contractions, and using more elevated language.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or structured version**. Below are the key patterns observed:\n\n1. **Formal Vocabulary**:  \n   - Replace colloquial phrases with more formal synonyms (e.g., \"upon your arrival\" for \"once you get there\"; \"entire story\" for \"whole story\").\n   - Update terms like \"fabricated\" for \"made up\" (colloquial to formal).\n\n2. **Polite/Grateful Tone**:  \n   - Recast direct thanks (\"Thanks for your help\") into more formal expressions (\"Your assistance is much appreciated\").\n   - Rephrase opinions to use a more formal structure (e.g., \"It is my opinion that...\").\n\n3. **Grammatical Formality**:  \n   - Add relative pronouns like \"whom\" for clarity and formality (e.g., \"the lawyer whom I met\").\n\n4. **Structural Adjustments**:  \n   - Modify sentence phrasing to improve readability and professionalism (e.g., replacing contractions or shifting perspective).\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nThe instruction was to **convert the input sentences into more formal, polite, or structured versions** by using more elevated language, rephrasing gratitude and opinions, incorporating formal vocabulary, and enhancing grammatical formality.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs where a friend transformed each input into an output according to some hidden instruction. My job is to figure out what that original instruction was. Let me start by analyzing each pair carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"She looks like her sister.\"\nOutput: \"She resembles her sister.\"\nHmm, so \"looks like\" becomes \"resembles.\" Both words mean similar, but maybe \"resembles\" is more formal or maybe used when talking about physical appearance? Or maybe it's just a synonym substitution, but maybe with a slight shift in connotation. Or perhaps \"resembles\" is a more elegant version. But not sure yet.\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: \"Please call once you get there.\"\nOutput: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\nSo here, \"once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival.\" That seems like changing the phrasing from a time reference (\"once you arrive\") to a more formal expression. \"Upon your arrival\" sounds more polite. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase using more formal language?\n\nThird input-output:\nInput: \"This song is fire.\"\nOutput: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\nHere, \"fire\" is slang meaning excellent, while \"incredibly good\" is a more literal translation. So perhaps the instruction was to replace informal slang with more standard wording, using a synonym or phrase that means the same thing but is more formal or standard.\n\nFourth pair:\nInput: \"I considered many approaches.\"\nOutput: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\nSo the subject-verb structure is flipped: \"I considered\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered.\" That's a change in perspective. The original is from the first person (subject) to the third person plural, and also the order is changed. Wait, \"I considered\" vs \"were considered.\" Hmm, maybe it's rephrasing the sentence as a passive voice? But the original is active. Wait, no. The original is \"I considered,\" which is active, and the output is \"Various approaches were considered,\" which is passive. So maybe the instruction is to convert the sentence into passive voice?\n\nFifth input-output:\nInput: \"Thanks for your help.\"\nOutput: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\nHere, thanking someone becomes expressing appreciation for their help. So \"thanks\" is converted into a phrase that thanks them by mentioning their assistance. So maybe the instruction involves replacing \"thanks\" with a longer expression that thanks them through recognition of their action.\n\nNow, putting these all together. Each output seems to involve transforming the input in a way that changes certain key terms or phrases. Let me list the transformations:\n\n1. Synonym replacement (looks/resembles, fire/incredibly good)\n2. Formal phrasing (\"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival\")\n3. Passive voice conversion (\"I considered\" → \"were considered\")\n4. Rewriting the thank you with emphasis on their help (\"thanks\" → \"your assistance is much appreciated\")\n\nBut wait, the fifth example isn't a synonym replacement. It's a structural change. Similarly, the fourth example is a structural change (passive vs active). The second example is a phrasal substitution. The first example is a synonym substitution. The third example is a synonym substitution. So maybe the instruction isn't uniform across all examples, but perhaps there's a common thread.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version. Let's check:\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\n- \"resembles\" instead of \"looks like\" – could be part of making it more formal.\n- \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"once you get there\" – definitely more formal.\n- \"incredibly good\" instead of \"fire\" – formalizing the slang.\n- \"Various approaches were considered\" instead of \"I considered many approaches\" – changing perspective from first to third person, and passive voice. Also formal.\n- \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" instead of \"Thanks for your help\" – again, changing perspective to third person and expanding the phrase.\n\nSo maybe the instruction was to transform the inputs into a more formal, polite, or grammatically structured version. Let's see if all outputs align with that.\n\nWait, but the fourth example's output is \"Various approaches were considered\" instead of \"I considered many approaches.\" That's a big shift. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the entire sentence in a different structure, perhaps passive voice and third person.\n\nBut let's check the first input-output again. \"She looks like her sister.\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" So \"resembles\" is another synonym, but maybe part of making it more formal. \"Looks like\" can sometimes be colloquial, while \"resembles\" is more neutral or literary.\n\nSimilarly, \"upon your arrival\" versus \"once you get there\" – both correct, but the former is more formal or old-fashioned.\n\nThe third example: \"fire\" to \"incredibly good\" – replacing slang with an adjective phrase. So this might be part of using more precise or formal language.\n\nThe fifth example: \"Thanks for your help\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" – this is a structural change, but also using a more indirect form of expression. Instead of directly thanking, it acknowledges their help in a more detailed way.\n\nThe fourth example: Changing from active to passive voice, first person to third person. So the sentence becomes less personal and more about the approaches rather than the speaker's action.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite version, possibly restructuring the sentence, using more formal synonyms, passive voice, third person, etc.\n\nBut then why does the second example use \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"on arrival\"? Because \"upon\" is more formal. So the instruction includes using more formal prepositions or expressions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to convert the inputs into a more professional or academic style. For example, replacing contractions (if any), using more formal phrasing, etc.\n\nLooking back, the outputs don't seem to have contractions replaced. For example, the input \"Please call once...\" has \"call upon\" instead of \"call once\". So maybe replacing \"once\" with \"upon your arrival\" is part of making it more formal.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the instruction is to replace specific phrases with others. Let's look at the second example's transformation: \"once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival.\" So \"once\" here is a time adverb, while \"upon\" is a preposition that introduces the noun clause. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase common phrases using more formal equivalents.\n\nSimilarly, the first example's \"looks like\" is replaced with \"resembles,\" which is a synonym but perhaps a more neutral word. The third example's \"fire\" (slang) is replaced with \"incredibly good,\" a direct equivalent.\n\nThe fourth example's \"I considered\" becomes \"various approaches were considered\" – so changing the subject from first person singular to third person plural, and changing active to passive voice. This makes the statement more general, less about the speaker's action and more about the approaches themselves.\n\nThe fifth example's transformation is the most substantial: changing a simple \"Thanks\" into a longer phrase that thanks them by referencing their help. So this might be part of rephrasing gratitude in a more indirect or detailed way.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction likely involves several components: replacing informal or slang terms with more standard ones, converting phrases into more formal equivalents (like changing \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival\"), restructuring sentences into passive voice or third person, and rephrasing expressions of gratitude into longer, more elaborate phrases.\n\nBut perhaps the main instruction is to transform the input into a more formal, polite version, using synonym replacements and structural changes. However, looking at the fourth example, the passive voice might be a key element. Let me check the fourth input-output again:\n\nInput: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n\nSo the original is active voice (\"I did\"), and the output is passive (\"were considered\"). The subject is changed from first person singular (\"I\") to third person plural (\"approaches\"). So the entire sentence is restructured into passive voice and third person. That seems like a significant transformation. If this is the case, then the instruction might be to convert the input into passive voice and refer to the subject as \"various approaches\" instead of \"I\".\n\nBut why in the fifth example, \"Thanks for your help\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" That doesn't fit passive voice. So maybe the instruction has multiple parts. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction is to make the input more formal, which includes using passive voice when appropriate, replacing informal terms, using more formal phrasing, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly involving passive voice, synonym replacement, phrasal changes, etc. But how do all these examples align?\n\nWait, looking at the third example's input and output: \"This song is fire.\" Output is \"This song is incredibly good.\" So here, replacing the slang term \"fire\" with a descriptive phrase. So maybe the instruction involves replacing informal adjectives with more descriptive or standard ones.\n\nIn the first example, \"resembles\" is a synonym for \"looks like,\" but maybe more formal. In the third example, replacing \"fire\" (slang) with \"incredibly good\" (descriptive). So perhaps the instruction is to replace informal or colloquial terms with more formal or precise alternatives.\n\nAdditionally, the second example's transformation uses more formal prepositions (\"upon your arrival\" instead of \"once you get there\"), which adds formality.\n\nThe fifth example transforms a simple \"Thanks\" into a longer phrase that thanks them by referring to their assistance. This could be part of making the gratitude more indirect or detailed.\n\nThe fourth example's passive voice and third person may be a separate aspect. So maybe the instruction combines multiple elements: replacing informal terms, using more formal language structures (phrases, prepositions, voice), and restructuring sentences.\n\nBut how to distill this into a single instruction? Let's think about possible instructions that would cover all these cases.\n\nOne possibility is that the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, using synonym substitutions, phrasal replacements, passive voice, and structural changes. Alternatively, the instruction might specifically ask to convert the inputs into passive voice, but then why the third example's \"fire\" becomes \"incredibly good\"?\n\nWait, the fourth example's input-output clearly shows a structural change (active to passive) plus a change in subject. The fifth example shows a structural change (first person to third person) but not passive voice. The third example doesn't show a structural change, just a synonym replacement. The second example is phrasal replacement without structural change.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the instruction has multiple parts. For example, rephrase to be more formal, which could include various elements like synonym substitution, phrasal changes, and/or structural changes like passive voice.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might be to translate each input into a more formal or academic version by replacing certain words or phrases with their more formal counterparts. For example, \"fire\" → \"incredibly good,\" \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival,\" \"look like\" → \"resemble,\" etc. Additionally, in the fourth example, converting to passive voice and changing the subject to \"various approaches.\"\n\nBut how to phrase this as a single instruction? Maybe the instruction was to \"rephrase each sentence into a more formal or academic version by replacing informal terms, adjusting phrasing, and/or restructuring sentences as needed.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to \"replace informal or slang terms with more precise synonyms, convert time-based phrases to formal alternatives, and use passive voice where appropriate.\"\n\nBut let me check if all the outputs align with such an instruction. For instance, the fifth example's transformation is \"Thanks for your help\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" This is a significant change. If the instruction is about replacing informal terms, then \"help\" is a bit informal, but \"assistance\" is more formal. So replacing \"help\" with \"assistance,\" which is part of making it more formal. Similarly, \"much appreciated\" is a more formal way of expressing gratitude. So that fits.\n\nIn the fourth example, \"considered\" becomes \"were considered\" (passive voice), which adds formality. The third example's \"fire\" is replaced with \"incredibly good,\" which is more descriptive. The second example uses \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"once you get there,\" adding formality.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version by making the following changes: replacing informal terms with more formal ones, converting time expressions into more formal equivalents, and using passive voice where possible.\n\nAlternatively, considering the output of the fourth example: \"Various approaches were considered\" – this could be a way to make it more objective and less about the speaker's action. So if the original is about the speaker considering approaches, the output makes it about the approaches being considered, which is more objective.\n\nSo maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more objective or professional tone, possibly by making the sentence passive, changing the subject to something more neutral (like \"various approaches\"), and using more formal language.\n\nPutting all this together, the instruction likely requires rephrasing each input into a more formal, objective, or polite version. The exact steps would vary based on context, but common changes would include synonym substitution, phrasal adjustments, passive voice, and restructuring sentences to avoid first-person references when appropriate.\n\nTo confirm, let's check the fifth example again: \"Thanks for your help\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Here, \"thanks\" is replaced with \"Your assistance is much appreciated,\" which is a longer expression of gratitude that directly refers to their help. So the instruction might involve replacing \"thanks\" with expressions of gratitude that mention their action.\n\nBut how to encapsulate all these variations into a single instruction? Perhaps the instruction was to \"rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version by replacing informal terms, adjusting phrasing for formality, and converting to passive voice when applicable.\"\n\nAlternatively, since the outputs sometimes involve passive voice (fourth example) and sometimes don't (third example), but the third example still shows a synonym substitution, maybe the instruction isn't tied to a single transformation but a combination.\n\nWait, but the fifth example doesn't use passive voice or synonym substitution; it's a completely different phrasing. So maybe the instruction allows for different transformations depending on context, but the overall goal is to make the output more formal or polite.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to convert each input into a more formal version using synonym substitution, phrasal replacements, and structural changes as needed. The key is to make the output more formal, using more precise or elevated language.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the verbs used in the outputs. For example, \"resembles,\" \"upon,\" \"incredibly good,\" \"considered\" (passive), \"assisted.\" All these are more formal or precise than their counterparts in the inputs.\n\nSo the instruction might be to rephrase the input by replacing informal or colloquial vocabulary with more precise or formal terms, adjusting phrasing to increase formality, and where possible, restructuring sentences to be more passive or objective.\n\nGiven that, the instruction could be something like:\n\n\"Rephrase each sentence into a more formal version by replacing informal or slang terms with precise synonyms, adjusting phrasing to increase formality, and restructuring sentences where necessary (e.g., using passive voice, changing subject to third person, altering prepositions or conjunctions for formality).\"\n\nBut maybe even more concise. Alternatively, the instruction could have been to \"translate each input into a more polite and formal version, using synonyms and adjusting grammar as needed.\"\n\nHowever, considering the examples:\n\n- The third example's transformation is more about replacing slang than formality.\n- The fourth example's transformation involves passive voice and restructuring.\n- The fifth example's transformation is more about expanding the gratitude into a longer phrase.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is broader: to rephrase each input into a more formal, objective, or polite version, possibly using synonym replacement, phrasal adjustments, passive voice, and structural changes.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that all these transformations are part of making the output more formal or academic, the instruction could be \"Convert each sentence into a more formal register by replacing colloquial terms, adjusting phrasing, and restructuring as necessary.\"\n\nYes, that seems plausible. All the outputs align with a higher formality compared to the inputs. The third example replaces slang with a descriptive phrase, the second with more formal prepositions, the first with a synonym, the fourth with passive voice and third person, and the fifth with a longer, more polite expression of gratitude.\n\nTherefore, the instruction the user gave was likely to rephrase each input into a more formal or academic version by making appropriate linguistic adjustments, including but not limited to synonym substitution, phrasal changes, passive voice, and restructuring sentences for clarity and formality.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction the user provided was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or academic version** by making linguistic adjustments such as synonym substitution, phrasal changes, passive voice conversions, and restructuring sentences for clarity and formality. Below is the synthesis of the analysis:\n\n### Key Transformations Identified:\n1. **Synonym Replacement**:  \n   - \"looks like\" → \"resembles\" (neutral/formal synonym).\n   - \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\" (precise descriptor).\n\n2. **Formal Phrasing**:  \n   - \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\" (old-fashioned/prepositional adjustment).\n   - \"thanks\" → \"your assistance is much appreciated\" (longer, indirect gratitude).\n\n3. **Structural Changes**:  \n   - \"I considered many approaches.\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" (Passive voice, third-person plural shift).\n\n4. **Colloquial to Standard**:  \n   - Slang (\"fire\") → Standard adjectives (\"incredibly good\").\n\n5. **Politeness Adjustments**:  \n   - Direct commands (\"call\") → Formal phrasing (\"call upon\").\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe original instruction was to rephrase each input into a **more formal, objective, or polite version** by synonym substitution, phrasal adjustments, passive voice, and restructuring. The goal was to enhance formality, precision, and politeness in communication.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

Hmm. So, each input has a corresponding output, and the friend generated outputs that seem similar but slightly modified. Let me start by looking at the differences between each pair.\n\nFirst, let's list out the inputs and outputs again:\n\n1. Input: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n2. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n3. Input: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\n4. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n5. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\nLooking at these transformations, there are a few common elements. Let's break down each pair:\n\n1. The first output uses \"look forward to\" instead of \"can't tell the difference\". Wait, but the input here is actually about seeing someone later. The output rephrases it with a more formal tone. Maybe the instruction is to rewrite the input in a more polite or formal way? But not all inputs fit that pattern. For example, the third input is an informal statement (\"fire\") which becomes a more descriptive phrase (\"incredibly good\"). Similarly, the fourth input changes \"looks like\" to \"resembles\", which is a synonym. The fifth input changes \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" (adding a relative clause), which adds more structure.\n\nWait, but maybe the key is that the outputs are more \"refined\" versions of the inputs. Like, making them more grammatically correct or using more precise vocabulary. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction is to convert the input into a more formal or elegant version. Let me check each case:\n\n1. Original: \"See you tonight.\" The output is a more elaborate way of saying the same thing. So maybe the instruction is to rewrite the input as a more polite or formal expression. For example, instead of \"see you,\" use \"look forward to meeting you\".\n\n2. \"I can't tell the difference...\" becomes \"I find it hard to distinguish...\". Both express difficulty in perceiving a difference, but the output uses more formal language with \"it\" and \"distinguish\".\n\n3. \"This song is fire.\" The output is a more elaborate description. So perhaps the instruction is to replace informal phrases with more descriptive ones. \"Fire\" is slang for great, so \"incredibly good\" is a more standard way to express enthusiasm.\n\n4. \"She looks like her sister.\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" Here, \"resembles\" is a synonym of \"looks like\", but maybe it's about using more sophisticated synonyms.\n\n5. \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" This adds a relative clause by inserting \"whom\", changing from a simpler sentence to one with more complex structure. Maybe the instruction was to make the sentence more grammatically complex or use more specific pronouns/relative clauses.\n\nSo putting this together, the instruction could be something like \"Rewrite each input by replacing informal expressions with more formal, precise language, and/or adding more structure to the sentence.\" Or perhaps even more specifically, \"Convert informal statements into more refined, elegant phrasing while maintaining the original meaning.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to use more advanced grammar structures, like changing possessive to relative clauses (as in the fifth example) or using more precise verbs (like \"resembles\" instead of \"looks like\").\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they often replace contractions or informal phrasing with their expanded forms. For example, \"I can't\" becomes \"I find it hard\", \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\" (using \"whom\" instead of the contraction \"I met\"). Also, \"fire\" is replaced with \"incredibly good\". So perhaps the instruction was to expand contractions, remove colloquial terms, and enhance word choice with more precise synonyms or adjectives.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to transform each input into a more grammatically complex version by adding relative clauses, improving sentence structure, or enhancing vocabulary with more advanced synonyms.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis against the examples:\n\n1. \"See you tonight.\" → Formal expression of anticipation. So replacing the casual \"see you\" with a more polite \"look forward to meeting you\".\n\n2. \"I can't tell the difference...\" → Using \"find it hard to distinguish\" which is more formal and uses a more precise verb phrase.\n\n3. \"This song is fire.\" → Instead of using slang, describe it as \"incredibly good\" which is a more standard expression of approval.\n\n4. \"She looks like her sister.\" → Replace the informal \"looks like\" with the more precise \"resembles\".\n\n5. \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Change \"I met\" to \"whom I met\", adding a relative clause for more structure, and perhaps replacing \"was\" with \"was\" (but that's similar). However, maybe the instruction was to insert a relative clause where none existed before, like using \"whom\" here.\n\nSo considering all these transformations, the instruction seems to be to take each input and rephrase it in a more formal, grammatically complex, and linguistically precise manner. The key elements would involve expanding contractions, replacing informal terms with more sophisticated alternatives, enhancing sentence structure through the addition of relative clauses, and refining word choices for clarity and elegance.\n\nTherefore, the likely instruction was something along the lines of: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal, elegant, and grammatically complex version while preserving the original meaning. Use proper grammar, avoid contractions, and replace informal expressions with precise vocabulary.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **refine and rephrase each input into a more formal, elegant, and grammatically complex version** while maintaining the original meaning. Key components of the instruction included:\n\n1. **Replacing informal terms with synonyms or more precise language**:\n   - \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\"\n   - \"looks like\" → \"resembles\"\n   - \"fire\" (slang) → \"incredibly good\"\n\n2. **Enhancing sentence structure**:\n   - Adding relative clauses (e.g., \"whom I met\" instead of \"I met\")\n   - Rewriting contractions to full forms (\"See you\" → \"I look forward to meeting you\")\n\n3. **Improving grammar and syntax**:\n   - Expanding phrases (\"meeting you\" vs. \"I look forward to meeting you\")\n   - Using more formal verb phrases (\"find it hard\" vs. \"can't tell\")\n\n**Final Instruction**:  \n\"Rewrite each input into a more refined, grammatically complex, and linguistically precise version while preserving the core message. Avoid contractions, enhance vocabulary, and structure sentences to convey elegance and formality.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs where a friend transformed each input into a corresponding output following a specific instruction. My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction based on these examples.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to see if there's a pattern or common transformation applied.\n\nInput 1: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\nHmm, comparing these two. The first input is a question asking capability. The output rephrases it but changes some words. Let's break down the output: \"Would you be able\" instead of the original \"Can you\", \"accomplish all these tasks\" instead of \"do all these tasks\". So maybe the instruction is to transform the original sentence into a more polite or indirect question, possibly using synonyms or rephrasing parts.\n\nSecond input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\nOriginal is an expression of gratitude. The output restates it in different words. The output doesn't seem to change the sentiment but uses a longer phrase. Maybe the instruction is to convert the input into a more formal or elaborate version?\n\nThird input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\nSimilar structure here. The output is a direct translation of the original but with slightly different wording. So maybe replacing the verb \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\"?\n\nFourth input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\nThis seems like a significant restructuring. The original is a statement expressing doubt about taking action. The output is phrased as a suggestion that no action should be taken. So maybe the instruction is to convert the input into a recommendation against action, using formal language (\"it is suggested\") and rephrasing \"don't think it's a good idea\" as a suggestion to not act.\n\nFifth input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\"\nHere, the subject is changed from first person singular (\"I\") to third person plural (\"Various\"), and \"considered\" is kept but with \"were\" added? Wait, no—original is past tense, output is also past tense. The main change is replacing \"many approaches\" with \"various approaches.\" So perhaps the instruction involves generalizing or paraphrasing the input with synonyms or broader terms.\n\nNow, looking for a common thread across all these transformations. Let's categorize each possible aspect:\n\n1. **Question vs Statement**: The first input is a question, output is a statement. But the fourth input is a statement whose output is a suggestion. Not sure if this is a key factor.\n\n2. **Tone/Politeness**: Second and first outputs might be seen as more formal or polite. Third output is a synonym replacement, more neutral. Fourth is a shift to a formal suggestion. Fifth is also a bit more formal.\n\n3. **Word Replacement**:\n   - \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\"\n   - \"Thanks\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated\"\n   - \"I considered\" → \"Various approaches were considered\"\n\n4. **Structure Changes**:\n   - Input 4 becomes a passive voice, \"no action should be taken,\" whereas input is active (\"we don't think it's a good idea\").\n   - Input 5 changes first-person to third-person.\n\nWait, another angle: For each input, the output seems to be a rephrasing but often using more formal or standard phrasing. For example, \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate,\" which is more formal. \"Don't think it's a good idea\" becomes \"it is suggested that no action should be taken,\" which is more formal and uses a passive construction. \"Considered many approaches\" becomes \"various approaches were considered,\" which might be rephrasing \"many\" to \"various.\"\n\nPerhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more standardized or formal version, using synonyms, adjusting sentence structure, or making it more polite.\n\nBut let's check the fifth input again: \"I considered many approaches\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" The subject \"I\" is replaced with \"Various,\" which might be a way to make it more general. Alternatively, changing from first person to third person. Also, \"considered\" is in present tense in the input but past in output? Wait, both are past tense. Hmm. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a passive voice where applicable. Let's see:\n\n- Input 4: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → \"No action should be taken at this stage.\" But the output isn't exactly passive. However, \"It is suggested that no action should be taken\" is a passive structure.\n\n- Input 5: \"I considered...\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" That's a passive voice transformation. So maybe the instruction was to convert the sentence into passive voice when possible. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\nInput 1: Question → Output? Maybe not, since the first output isn't in passive. Input 2 is a statement, output is also a statement. Input 3: \"I can't stand\" becomes \"his temper is not tolerable by me\" but the output is \"I cannot tolerate his temper,\" which is active. So passive might not be the main rule here.\n\nWait, but for input 4, the output is passive. Maybe the instruction varies depending on the input type? But that seems inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction is to convert the sentence into a more formal or academic style, using synonyms and restructuring.\n\nAnother approach: Look for a common element in all outputs. For example, all outputs seem to use more formal language. \"Would you be able\" (instead of \"can you\"), \"Your assistance\" (instead of \"thanks\"), \"cannot tolerate\" (instead of \"can't stand\"), \"It is suggested\" (instead of \"don't think\"), \"Various approaches\" (instead of \"many approaches\"). So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal, professional, or academic tone, possibly using synonyms and restructuring sentences.\n\nBut why would \"Many approaches\" become \"various approaches\"? \"Varied\" or \"numerous\" could work too. But \"various\" is a synonym. So perhaps replacing \"many\" with \"various\" in some contexts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to make the sentence more indirect or less direct. For example, \"Can you...\" becomes \"Would you be able...\" which is a softer way of asking. Similarly, \"I can't stand\" becomes \"I cannot tolerate,\" which is less harsh.\n\nLooking at the fourth input: Original is a negative statement, output is a suggestion not to act, which could be a way to indirectly say \"don't do anything,\" but phrased as a recommendation. So maybe the instruction is to convert negative statements into positive recommendations to avoid action.\n\nBut then the first input is a question, not a statement. How does that fit? If the instruction is about responding to a request (like \"Can you do X?\"), then the output could be a more polite answer. But the fifth input is a statement (\"I considered...\"), output is a paraphrase.\n\nWait, the fifth input is a statement, output is also a statement. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase any input into a more formal or neutral version, regardless of the input type.\n\nLet me look for a common structure or transformation across all inputs:\n\n1. Replace contractions (if any): \"don't\" → \"is not suggested\"\nBut the fourth input doesn't have contractions. The first input has \"can you\" which becomes \"would you be able.\"\n\nAlternatively, consider that the outputs often use \"is\" or \"was\" where the input uses \"I\" or \"do\". Like input 1: \"can you\" → output starts with \"Would you be able,\" which doesn't include \"is\" or \"was.\" Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at the verbs:\n\n- Input 1: can → would be able\n- Input 2: thanks → Your assistance\n- Input 3: can't stand → cannot tolerate\n- Input 4: don't think → is suggested\n- Input 5: considered → were considered\n\nInteresting. For input 4, the verb \"think\" becomes \"suggested.\" So maybe the instruction was to rephrase \"think it's a good idea\" into \"is suggested to not take action.\"\n\nAnother angle: All outputs seem to start with a modal verb or a phrase indicating possibility or suggestion. For example:\n\n- \"Would you be able...\" (could)\n- \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" (could imply \"is needed\")\n- \"I cannot tolerate...\" (can't)\n- \"It is suggested...\" (should)\n- \"Various approaches were considered.\" (were)\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to transform the input into a statement that either suggests an action or expresses appreciation or capability, using appropriate modals or structures.\n\nAlternatively, considering that all outputs are questions except the second one. Wait, the second input is a statement, and the output is also a statement. The first is a question turned into a statement, and the fourth is a statement turned into a suggestion.\n\nThis inconsistency makes it harder to find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, think about the outputs as responses to the inputs. For example:\n\nInput 1: A question asking capability. Output is a rephrased question implying the same meaning but phrased as a suggestion.\n\nInput 2: Gratitude → output restates as appreciation.\n\nInput 3: Negative emotion → output restates similarly.\n\nInput 4: Opinion against action → output suggests inaction.\n\nInput 5: Personal opinion → output restates with different wording.\n\nMaybe the instruction is to respond to the input in a specific way: for instance, if the input is a request for capability, answer it in a certain form; if it's an opinion, rephrase it as a suggestion; etc. But this would require knowing the categories of each input, which we don't have.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs' structures:\n\n- Outputs 1 and 4 start with \"Would you be able...\" and \"It is suggested...\", suggesting they might be responses to requests (like the first input is a request, output is an answer to that request).\n\nSimilarly, input 2 is a thank you, output is a response thanking back. Input 3 is an expression of frustration, output is restated. Input 5 is a personal reflection, output is restated.\n\nIf that's the case, perhaps the instruction was to turn the input into a formal or standardized response, possibly using specific phrases depending on the type of input.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If the input is a request (like the first input), output is a polite answer suggesting ability.\n- If the input is an expression of thanks, output restates as appreciation.\n- If the input is a complaint, output restates similarly.\n- If the input is an opinion against action, output suggests inaction formally.\n- If the input is a statement about considering approaches, output restates with a synonym.\n\nIn this case, the instruction might be something like: \"Convert the input into a standardized response using appropriate phrasing for the type of input.\"\n\nBut how to verify this? Let's see:\n\nFor input 1 (request), output is a response indicating capability. Input 2 (gratitude) output is a response expressing thanks. Input 3 (complaint) output restates the complaint. Input 4 (opinion) output is a recommendation. Input 5 (statement) output restates with a synonym.\n\nThis seems plausible. But why would \"I considered many approaches\" become \"Various approaches were considered\"? Maybe because \"various\" is a synonym and \"were considered\" fits the past tense. So perhaps for inputs where the original has a first-person perspective or a generalization (\"many\"), the output rephrases to a third-person perspective with more formal language.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to make the input more formal by replacing contractions, adding \"to be\" where necessary, and using more formal vocabulary. For example:\n\n- \"Can you...\" becomes \"Would you be able...\" (adds \"be\" and a more formal phrase)\n- \"Thanks\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" (replaces contraction with full phrase and adds \"is much\" for emphasis)\n- \"I can't stand\" becomes \"I cannot tolerate\" (replaces contraction with full phrase)\n- \"We don't think...\" becomes \"It is suggested that no action should be taken\" (adds \"is suggested\" and a more formal structure)\n- \"I considered...\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered\" (replaces \"many\" with \"various,\" uses passive voice?)\n\nBut wait, \"were considered\" doesn't add a passive voice; it's still active. Wait, in the output, \"approaches were considered\" is active, but maybe it's just a rephrasing to avoid repetition. Or perhaps it's changing \"many approaches\" to \"various approaches\" for variety.\n\nPutting all this together, the instruction might be: \"Transform each input into a more formal, polite, or standardized response by replacing contractions, adjusting verb forms, using synonyms, and rephrasing as necessary to maintain the original meaning.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be specifically designed to convert certain types of inputs into particular structures. For example:\n\n- If the input is a question about capability, rephrase as a polite assertion of ability.\n- If the input is an expression of thanks, respond with an equally formal expression of appreciation.\n- If the input is a negative statement (e.g., \"I can't stand...\"), rephrase it neutrally (e.g., \"I cannot tolerate...\").\n- If the input is an opinion against action, rephrase it as a formal recommendation against action.\n- If the input is a statement about considering approaches, rephrase it with a synonym.\n\nIn this case, the instruction might be a set of rules or templates applied to different input types.\n\nHowever, without explicit information on the input types (like whether they're requests, expressions of gratitude, complaints, opinions, etc.), it's challenging to pinpoint the exact instruction. But based on the examples, the instruction likely involves rephrasing inputs into a more formal, polite, or standardized version, possibly using synonyms, adjusting sentence structure, and maintaining the original meaning through various transformations.\n\nAnother possible angle: All outputs seem to start with a modal verb (could, would, is, cannot). This suggests that the instruction involves transforming the input into a statement that expresses possibility, ability, or suggestion. For example:\n\n- \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able...\"\n- \"I can't stand...\" → \"I cannot tolerate...\"\n- \"We don't think...\" → \"It is suggested...\"\n- \"I considered...\" → \"Various approaches were considered\" (maybe rephrasing \"considered\" into a neutral statement)\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to turn the input into a question or statement that implies the same thing but using different words. For instance, turning \"Can you...\" into \"Are you capable...\" or similar. But the first output uses \"Would you be able,\" which is a bit different.\n\nGiven the variations, the most comprehensive instruction seems to be a combination of multiple rules: adjust verb forms, replace contractions with full phrases, use more formal language, rephrase nouns with synonyms, and structure the output in a way that's polite or formal.\n\nTo confirm, let's see if all examples fit this general instruction:\n\n1. \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able...\" — replacing \"can\" with \"be able\" for politeness, adding \"would\" to soften the question.\n2. \"Thanks\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" — replacing \"thanks\" with a more formal expression, adding \"is much\" for emphasis.\n3. \"I can't stand...\" → \"I cannot tolerate...\" — replacing contraction with full phrase and rephrasing.\n4. \"We don't think...\" → \"It is suggested...\" — rephrasing negative opinion into a positive suggestion, using formal language.\n5. \"I considered...\" → \"Various approaches were considered\" — changing \"many\" to \"various\" for synonymy and keeping past tense with \"were considered\" (active vs. passive? Not sure, but \"were considered\" is still active).\n\nSo the instruction likely involved rephrasing each input into a more formal, polite, or standardized form, possibly using synonyms, adjusting contractions, changing verb tenses or forms, and restructuring sentences to maintain the original meaning while adhering to specific stylistic guidelines.\n\nThe most accurate answer would probably be that the instruction was to convert each input into a formal or standardized response by replacing contractions, adjusting verb forms, and using more polite phrasing where applicable. However, given the examples, especially the fourth one which transforms a negative statement into a positive suggestion, it's possible that the instruction also involved rephrasing negative statements into affirmative recommendations against action.\n\nBut to determine the exact instruction, we need to find a single, precise rule that encompasses all cases. Let's analyze each transformation again:\n\n1. **Question Handling**: The first input is a question, and the output is a rephrased question but with more formal phrasing (\"Would you be able\" instead of \"Can you\"). This suggests that the instruction might involve repurposing questions to be answered in a certain way, perhaps using \"would\" to indicate possibility or willingness.\n\n2. **Gratitude**: The output uses \"Your assistance is much appreciated,\" which is a formal way of responding to \"Thanks.\" So here, the instruction might be to transform expressions of thanks into a more formal acknowledgment.\n\n3. **Negative Statements**: \"I can't stand\" becomes \"I cannot tolerate,\" which is a direct synonym but maintains the same meaning. The instruction here might be to replace contractions with their expanded forms and maintain neutrality.\n\n4. **Opinions Against Action**: The fourth input is an opinion against doing something, and the output is a recommendation not to act. This suggests the instruction includes rephrasing negative opinions into positive suggestions.\n\n5. **Personal Reflections**: The fifth input is a personal statement about considering approaches, and the output restates it with a synonym (\"various\" instead of \"many\"). The instruction here might be to use synonyms to rephrase for variety.\n\nGiven all these, the instruction is likely a combination of several rules:\n\n- Replace contractions with full phrases.\n- Adjust verb tenses and forms to match the context (e.g., \"do anything\" to passive \"should be taken\").\n- Use more formal or neutral language instead of informal or direct phrasing.\n- Rephrase with synonyms where possible to maintain the original meaning.\n- Structure the response to reflect politeness or formality based on the input type.\n\nHowever, the most concise instruction that fits all examples could be: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal or standardized response by replacing contractions, adjusting verb forms, using synonyms, and restructuring sentences where necessary to maintain clarity and politeness.\"\n\nBut given the specific examples, especially the fourth input where the transformation is a complete shift in perspective (opinion to recommendation), the instruction might also involve converting negative opinions into affirmative suggestions.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the fourth input's output is a suggestion rather than a negative response, the instruction might be to rephrase the input into a recommendation if it expresses doubt or hesitation.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the most precise instruction would likely be:\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or standardized response by replacing contractions with full phrases, adjusting verb forms, and restating the",

Hmm, the user provided five input-output examples and wants me to determine the general rule or instruction their friend used. \n\nFirst, I need to look at each pair and see what changes were made. Let me go through them one by one.\n\n1. **Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\"**  \n   **Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"**  \n   Comparing these, the only difference is \"can't stand\" vs. \"cannot tolerate\". So maybe the instruction was to replace \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\"? But wait, looking at other examples might confirm if there's a pattern here. For instance, the second input-output pair.\n\n2. **Input: \"She looks like her sister.\"**  \n   **Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"**  \n   Here, \"looks like\" is changed to \"resembles\". So perhaps the rule is replacing common phrases like these with synonyms. That seems possible. Let's check another example.\n\n3. **Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\"**  \n   **Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"**  \n   The structure changed from \"I think [clause]\" to \"It is my opinion [that clause]\". This is a restructuring of the sentence to make it more formal. Interesting. So maybe the instruction involves rephrasing opinions into a more formal statement?\n\n4. **Input: \"The whole story was made up.\"**  \n   **Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"**  \n   Again, replacing parts of speech: \"whole\" to \"entire\", \"made up\" to \"fabricated\". So possibly replacing certain adjectives or phrasal verbs with their synonyms or more formal terms?\n\n5. **Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\"**  \n   **Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"**  \n   This changes the structure again: \"can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish\". So another phrasal change, possibly making the expression more formal or using a different collocation.\n\nWait, but in some cases, like the first example, \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\", that's a verb phrase replacement. The second uses a synonym (\"resembles\" vs \"looks like\"). Third is a structural change. Fourth is a noun-adjective change (\"whole\" to \"entire\") and phrasal (\"made up\" to \"fabricated\"). Fifth is another phrasal change. \n\nSo the instruction might involve a combination of different transformations. But the key is to find a unifying principle. Let's see:\n\nLooking at all outputs, they seem to be more formal or precise versions of the inputs. Let's categorize the changes:\n\n- Replacing casual phrases with more formal ones (e.g., \"can't stand\" -> \"cannot tolerate\", \"made up\" -> \"fabricated\").\n- Using synonyms for similar words (like \"resembles\" instead of \"looks like\").\n- Restructuring sentences for clarity or formality (e.g., changing first-person thoughts to \"it is my opinion\").\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or precise version, replacing informal expressions with their more standard counterparts.\n\nBut let's check each example against this hypothesis:\n\n1. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" So replaced \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\"—both negative statements about someone's temper. Seems like replacing an informal phrase with its more formal equivalent.\n\n2. \"She looks like her sister.\" Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" Here, \"resembles\" is a synonym, and \"looks like\" is a more colloquial way of saying \"resembles.\" So again, replacing a casual phrase with a synonym.\n\n3. \"I think that this is interesting.\" Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" This transforms a personal opinion into a more formal phrasing. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase subjective statements into a more formal \"it is my opinion...\" structure.\n\n4. \"The whole story was made up.\" Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Here, \"whole\" -> \"entire\" (synonym), \"made up\" -> \"fabricated\" (a more formal or precise term). So replacing parts of speech with their more formal equivalents.\n\n5. \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" Changing the phrasal structure from \"can't tell the difference\" to \"find it hard to distinguish.\"\n\nPutting this together, the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more formal or precise version by replacing informal expressions with their synonyms or more standard terms, restructuring sentences where necessary, or converting subjective statements into more formal expressions of opinion.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they are more academic or formal. So the instruction could be part of a task to convert informal language into more formal or professional English. Alternatively, it could be part of a style guide correction, like replacing certain phrasal verbs with their synonyms.\n\nWait, but the first example's input is a single sentence, and the output is also a single sentence. All others follow the same pattern. So the instruction must apply to each input individually.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentence using a more sophisticated vocabulary, avoiding contractions, and perhaps restructuring for clarity. For example, replacing \"can't\" with \"cannot,\" using \"resemble\" instead of \"look like,\" converting \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion,\" replacing \"whole\" with \"entire,\" \"made up\" with \"fabricated,\" etc.\n\nSo the most plausible instruction is something like: \"Rewrite each sentence using more formal and precise language, replacing informal expressions with their synonyms or more standard alternatives, and restructuring sentences as needed to improve clarity and formality.\"\n\nAlternatively, if we look at each input-output pair specifically, there's a mix of different changes. However, the overarching theme seems to be making the language more formal, precise, or structurally varied.\n\nAnother possibility: the instruction might have been to rephrase the sentence using a more academic tone, replacing first-person narratives with third-person where appropriate, and using passive voice or more complex constructions. But in the third example, the structure changes from \"I think [something]\" to \"It is my opinion [that something].\" That suggests changing the subject and adding \"it is my opinion.\"\n\nWait, but the third input doesn't have any mention of opinions; the output does. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase any subjective statements (like \"I think\") into a more formal statement. However, not all inputs are subjective. For example, the first input is a statement of inability, the second a description, third an opinion, fourth a factual statement, fifth a complaint about distinguishing differences.\n\nSo the instruction might have been to rephrase any opinion or subjective statement into a more formal \"it is my opinion...\" structure, while others might just require replacing informal phrasing with more formal terms.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction was to replace certain verbs or phrases with their more precise counterparts. For example, replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate,\" which both mean disliking someone's temper, but using different phrasing.\n\nIn that case, the instruction might have been to replace specific idiomatic expressions or informal phrases with their more formal equivalents, either through synonym substitution or restructuring.\n\nBut to cover all examples, it's a bit tricky. Let's think of possible instructions that could generate these outputs.\n\nOption 1: Replace \"can't\" with \"cannot,\" \"made up\" with \"fabricated,\" \"whole\" with \"entire,\" \"tell the difference\" with \"distinguish,\" and similar replacements. Also, replace \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion.\"\n\nOption 2: Convert all first-person statements into third-person perspective (though in some cases, like the third example, the subject becomes \"it\"), but that's not exactly third-person.\n\nOption 3: Restructure sentences to use more formal phrasing, such as replacing \"I think\" with \"in my opinion\" or similar, and replacing \"can't\" with \"am unable to,\" but that's not exactly what's happening here.\n\nWait, the third input-output pair shows \"I think that this is interesting\" becoming \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" So changing the subject from \"I\" to \"it,\" and the structure from \"I think\" to \"it is my opinion.\"\n\nThis suggests that the instruction might be to rephrase any subjective statement (\"I think\") into a more formal structure by removing the speaker's perspective and presenting it as an objective opinion expressed through \"it is my opinion.\"\n\nSimilarly, the fifth example changes \"I can't tell the difference\" to \"I find it hard to distinguish,\" which is a different phrasing but still in first person.\n\nSo combining these observations, the instruction might be:\n\n\"Rewrite each sentence by replacing subjective statements ('I think', 'I believe') with a formal opinion phrased as 'It is my opinion that...', and replacing informal expressions like 'can't stand', 'made up' with their more precise or formal equivalents. Additionally, replace other informal phrasings with their synonyms.\"\n\nBut that's quite a long instruction. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was simply to rephrase the input into a more formal style, which would cover various transformations.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be: \"Use more formal language by replacing contractions with full forms, using synonyms for common phrases, and restructuring sentences for clarity and precision.\"\n\nBut considering that some inputs don't require changing, like the second example (\"She looks like her sister\" to \"She resembles her sister\"), but the third requires changing the structure. So perhaps the instruction was more specific, targeting particular patterns.\n\nWait, the second example's input-output pair is a direct synonym replacement. Maybe the instruction was to replace all instances of \"look like\" with \"resemble.\" But in the first example, \"can't stand\" is replaced with \"cannot tolerate,\" which isn't a synonym but a different phrasing. Similarly, \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated.\"\n\nHmm, this inconsistency makes me think that perhaps the instruction wasn't about replacing synonyms but about converting certain expressions into more formal equivalents. For example, replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot bear,\" but in the output it's \"cannot tolerate.\" Maybe \"tolerate\" is considered a synonym in context. But \"stand\" and \"tolerate\" are somewhat different in nuance. So maybe the exact phrasing depends on the context.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction was to replace all instances of \"can't\" with \"cannot,\" \"look like\" with \"resemble,\" \"made up\" with \"fabricated,\" \"whole\" with \"entire,\" \"tell the difference\" with \"distinguish,\" and \"I think\" with \"my opinion\" or \"It is my opinion.\" But these are specific replacements rather than a general instruction.\n\nHowever, given that the friend followed the instruction for each input, it's likely that the instruction specified particular replacements for each input. But since the user provided the instruction as a single prompt, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal version by using synonyms or restructuring.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to translate each input into a more precise version, which could involve multiple steps like replacing informal phrases, restructuring sentences, and adding formal elements.\n\nBut to pinpoint the exact instruction, let's look for a pattern across all examples. Each output seems to be more formal or structured than the input. For example:\n\n- Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" (casual) → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" (formal)\n- \"She looks like her sister.\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" (using a synonym)\n- \"I think that this is interesting.\" → \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" (rephrasing as a formal opinion)\n- \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" (replacing \"whole\" and \"made up\" with synonyms)\n- \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" (changing phrasing)\n\nSo the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more formal, precise, or structured version by:\n\n1. Converting contractions to their expanded forms (e.g., \"can't\" → \"cannot\").\n2. Replacing common phrases with synonyms or more formal alternatives (e.g., \"look like\" → \"resemble,\" \"made up\" → \"fabricated\").\n3. Restructuring sentences for clarity, especially when expressing opinions (e.g., changing \"I think\" to \"it is my opinion\").\n4. Avoiding first-person perspective in some cases (though not all), but this varies.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been more specific, like \"replace each instance of 'can't' with 'cannot,' 'look like' with 'resemble,' etc., and when expressing opinions, rephrase them into a formal structure.\"\n\nBut given the examples provided, the most consistent instruction seems to be a combination of replacing certain phrases with their formal equivalents, synonyms, or rephrasing for clarity and formality. The exact instruction would depend on the context, but based on the given examples, the instruction likely asked to rephrase the input into a more formal version by using more precise language and appropriate phrasing, possibly targeting specific colloquialisms or phrases that were replaced with their formal counterparts.\n\nAnother angle: the outputs are often longer than the inputs, except for the third example. Wait, no, the third example's input and output are the same length. So that's not necessarily a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more precise version without changing the meaning, possibly by making the language more concise or formal. For example, replacing \"I think\" with \"In my opinion\" or removing the subject.\n\nBut the third example's output uses \"it is my opinion,\" which is a specific phrasing. So perhaps the instruction was to convert all first-person statements into this particular phrasing.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to rephrase any subjective statements into a more formal structure, replacing \"I think\" with \"In my opinion\" or \"It is my understanding that,\" etc. But the third example uses \"it is my opinion,\" which is specific.\n\nGiven the variety of changes across the examples, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact instruction, but the common thread is enhancing formality and precision through rephrasing. Therefore, the instruction most likely told the friend to rewrite each input in a more formal or precise manner, replacing informal expressions with their more standard equivalents, restructuring sentences where necessary, and converting subjective statements into a formalized opinion structure.\n\nTo summarize, after analyzing each input-output pair, the instruction was to rephrase the given sentence into a more formal or precise version by replacing informal phrasing, using synonyms for common expressions, rephrasing sentence structures for clarity, and converting subjective statements into a formal opinion phrasing.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to your friend was to **rephrase each input sentence into a more formal and precise version**, focusing on several key transformations:\n1. **Replacing Informal Phrases**: Convert contractions (e.g., \"can't\" to \"cannot\") and casual expressions (e.g., \"made up\" to \"fabricated\").\n2. **Synonym Substitution**: Replace colloquial terms with their formal or synonymous counterparts (e.g., \"resemble\" for \"look like\").\n3. **Structural Restructuring**: Modify sentence frameworks to enhance clarity, particularly when expressing opinions (e.g., replacing \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion\").\n4. **Formalizing Subjective Statements**: Transform first-person accounts into objective or impersonal phrasing (e.g., changing \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\").\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input sentence into a more formal and precise version** by replacing informal phrases, using synonyms, restructuring sentences, and converting subjective statements into a formal opinion format.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs where each input had a corresponding output. My job is to deduce the instruction based on these examples.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the input-output pairs again to see if I can spot any patterns or common transformations applied.\n\n1. Input: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\n2. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n3. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n4. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n5. Input: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\"\n\nLooking at these, maybe the instruction involves some kind of synonym substitution or rephrasing? Let's check each pair.\n\nFor the first input-output pair:\n- \"fire\" becomes \"incredibly good.\" Fire here likely means popular or impressive, so substituting synonyms.\n- The adjective structure changed from \"is fire\" (a state/quality) to \"is incredibly good.\" So replacing \"fire\" with \"incredibly good.\"\n\nSecond example:\n\"I considered many approaches.\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\"\nHere, the subject-verb order is inverted. Original: \"I considered... \" becomes \"Various approaches were considered.\" So changing the sentence structure by swapping subject and verb and adding \"were\".\n\nThird input:\n\"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\nOriginal uses \"whole\" which became \"entire\", another synonym. \"made up\" in this context means created or invented, so substituted with \"fabricated\".\n\nFourth input:\n\"She looks like her sister.\" → \"She resembles her sister.\"\n\"Looks like\" vs \"resembles\". Both are verbs meaning to resemble. So perhaps replacing the phrasing with a more formal synonym.\n\nFifth input:\n\"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\"\nHere, \"got\" as in understand, but the output uses \"understood\". Also, the object pronoun \"you\" is placed differently. Wait, original is \"I got what you said,\" output is \"I understood you.\" So the structure changed from \"got [object] what you said\" to \"understood you\". Hmm, not sure about that part. Alternatively, maybe \"got\" in this context is being replaced with \"understood\" directly, but the structure remains similar. Wait, the input is \"I got what you said.\" which might be an informal way of saying \"I understood your statement.\" So the output replaces \"got\" with \"understood\" and removes the \"what\" phrase.\n\nNow, looking for a unifying instruction. Let's see:\n\nPossible directions:\n- Replace informal expressions with more formal ones.\n- Use synonyms for certain words.\n- Restructure sentences by changing word order.\n- Modify parts of speech (e.g., adjectives to adverbs).\n\nLet me check each transformation step by step.\n\nFirst example: \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\". Here, \"fire\" is a term used colloquially to mean something is good or excellent. So substituting with a more descriptive adjective phrase. So maybe the instruction was to replace \"fire\" with an intensifier + adjective.\n\nBut why only the first input? Maybe it's part of a pattern. However, other examples don't seem to involve \"fire\". So maybe the instruction is to replace certain keywords with synonyms or phrases, but the examples given aren't enough to generalize.\n\nWait, let's look at the second example: \"considered many approaches\" becomes \"various approaches were considered.\" Here, the subject-verb order is flipped, and \"many\" becomes \"various\". So the instruction might involve restructuring the sentence: invert subject and verb, and substitute some adjectives (many→various). But then why does the third example have \"whole\" become \"entire\"? That's a different change. So maybe there's more than one instruction here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to take each input and generate an output that is a synonym of the original, but rephrased. However, the outputs here don't seem to be direct synonyms but rather rephrased versions. For instance, the first output is a rephrasing with an intensifier, the second changes the subject-verb structure, the third replaces \"whole\" with \"entire\", etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to apply a series of transformations: replacing certain words with their synonyms, adjusting sentence structure, etc. But how to unify all these changes?\n\nLooking for a common thread:\n\nAll outputs are more formal or less conversational than the inputs. For example, the first input is slang (\"fire\"), output uses a more literary expression. The second example changes from active to passive voice. The third uses \"entire\" instead of \"whole\", which are synonyms but \"entire\" is more formal. The fourth changes \"looks like\" to \"resembles\", which is a synonym. The fifth changes \"got\" to \"understood\" and the structure slightly.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to convert the input into a more formal, written English version, possibly using synonyms and rephrasing. But why exactly?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace certain phrases with their antonyms or synonyms. For example, \"made up\" (input 3) becomes \"fabricated\" (synonym), \"fire\" becomes \"incredibly good\" (synonym phrase), \"many approaches\" becomes \"various approaches\" (synonym), etc. But this seems too coincidental. Or maybe the instruction was to use a thesaurus for each word.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the verbs. Input verbs are considered, made up, looks, got. Outputs are \"were considered\", \"was fabricated\", \"resembles\", \"understood\". Not seeing a direct verb replacement here. Except for \"made up\" becoming \"fabricated\", which are synonyms.\n\nThe first output uses an adjective phrase (\"incredibly good\") where the input had \"fire\". So maybe the instruction was to replace nouns or adjectives with their synonyms, especially informal ones.\n\nWait, \"fire\" in the first input is an informal term for something being great. The output replaces it with \"incredibly good\", which is a more descriptive phrase. So perhaps the instruction was to rewrite the input by expanding phrases or replacing idiomatic expressions with more detailed descriptions.\n\nThe second input's structure is transformed from active to passive. Original: \"I considered...\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered.\" So changing the focus from the subject to the object, and using \"were considered\" instead of \"considered\".\n\nThird input changes \"whole\" to \"entire\". Both are adjectives meaning completely. So replacing with a synonym.\n\nFourth input replaces \"looks like\" with \"resembles\". Both are verbs indicating similarity.\n\nFifth input replaces \"got what you said\" with \"understood you\". \"Got\" here is informal for \"understand\". So replacing informal expressions with more formal ones.\n\nPutting this together, perhaps the instruction was to perform multiple transformations: replace informal terms with more formal ones, adjust sentence structures, replace words with synonyms, and use more descriptive phrases when possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to use a specific thesaurus entry for each word. But that's speculative.\n\nWait, let's check if all outputs follow a certain rule. For example:\n\n1. \"This song is fire.\" → \"This song is incredibly good.\" So \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\". The output is an intensified form.\n\n2. \"I considered many approaches.\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" Structure change: subject-verb inversion, and \"many\" → \"various\".\n\n3. \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" \"whole\" → \"entire\", \"made up\" → \"fabricated\".\n\n4. \"She looks like her sister.\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" \"looks like\" → \"resembles\".\n\n5. \"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\" \"got\" (understand) → \"understood\", and the structure changes from \"got what you said\" to \"understood you\".\n\nHmm, the first output has a different structure. Let's see:\n\nInput 1: Active voice with subject \"this song\". Output is also active but with subject \"this song\" followed by the new phrase. So no structural change there.\n\nInput 2: Changes from active to passive. Subject becomes \"approaches\" instead of \"I\", and adds \"were considered\".\n\nInput 3: Same subject (\"the story\"), adjective change \"whole\" → \"entire\", and the verb \"was made up\" becomes \"was fabricated\".\n\nInput 4: Same subject, \"she\", but the verb phrase \"looks like\" becomes \"resembles\".\n\nInput 5: Changes structure from \"I got what you said\" to \"I understood you\". Here, \"got\" (which can mean understood) is replaced by \"understood\", and the structure becomes a simple \"I understood you\", removing the \"what you said\" part.\n\nWait, in input 5, the original is \"I got what you said.\" The output is \"I understood you.\" So they both start with \"I\", but the structure changes. The input has \"got what you said\" which is a bit colloquial, whereas the output is a direct \"understood you\".\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to replace informal verb phrases with their more standard equivalents, adjust structure, and sometimes replace words with synonyms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a more formal, written English version by applying a series of transformations such as replacing colloquial terms, restructuring sentences, and using synonyms.\n\nBut how to formulate that as an instruction? Let's think: if someone gives you an input and asks you to generate an output that's a rephrased version using more formal language, synonyms, different sentence structures, etc. So the instruction might have been something like: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal version using synonyms and appropriate sentence structures.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been more specific. For example, \"Replace 'fire' with 'incredibly good,' 'approaches' with 'strategies,' etc.\" But without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, looking at all the outputs, maybe the instruction was to replace the original verbs with their synonyms, but in the examples, only some inputs have verbs replaced. For example:\n\nInput 1: \"is fire\" → output \"is incredibly good\" (no verb replaced, added adjective phrase).\nInput 2: \"considered\" → \"were considered\" (passive voice, subject changed).\nInput 3: \"was made up\" → \"was fabricated\" (synonym verb).\nInput 4: \"looks like\" → \"resembles\" (synonym verb).\nInput 5: \"got\" → \"understood\" (synonym verb), and changed structure.\n\nSo not all outputs involve verbs, and some involve sentence structure changes. This suggests that the instruction was broader: not just verb substitution but various transformations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to apply the following steps for each input:\n\n1. Check if the input contains an informal term or phrase and replace it with a synonym.\n2. Restructure the sentence if necessary, changing subject-verb order or clause structure.\n3. Replace certain adjectives with synonyms or more descriptive phrases.\n\nBut how to frame this as an instruction? Maybe the instruction was something like: \"Rewrite each sentence to make it more formal by replacing informal terms with synonyms, adjusting sentence structure where needed, and enhancing descriptive phrases.\"\n\nAlternatively, considering that the outputs often use more adjectives or adverbs, maybe the instruction was to add more descriptive elements to the input.\n\nWait, in input 1, \"fire\" is replaced with \"incredibly good\"—both are adjectives. So maybe the instruction was to expand phrases into more descriptive clauses or add adjectives.\n\nIn input 2, \"many approaches\" becomes \"various approaches\"—synonym adjectives.\n\nInput 3, \"whole\" → \"entire\"—same part of speech.\n\nInput 4, \"looks like\" → \"resembles\"—same structure, different verb.\n\nInput 5, \"got\" (past tense of get) → \"understood\" (past tense of understand)—same part of speech.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to replace certain words with their synonyms, specifically focusing on informal or less precise terms. Additionally, some sentence restructuring was done (like passive voice in input 2).\n\nBut why would the user give such a vague instruction? It's possible that the actual instruction was more about applying synonyms across the text, with some structural changes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into another language and then back, but that's unlikely since the outputs are similar in meaning.\n\nAnother approach: Look for common prefixes or suffixes. For example, \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\"—not much connection. \"Made up\" → \"fabricated\"—both end with \"-ed\". \"Considered many approaches\" → \"various approaches were considered\"—\"considered\" becomes \"were considered\".\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might involve using a thesaurus for each word, but the examples don't cover all words. Only the first input's main term is replaced.\n\nWait, perhaps the instruction was to replace the word \"fire\" with its antonym \"bad\" or synonym \"hot\", but that's not the case here. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to add a superlative or comparative adjective. But input 3 uses \"entire\" instead of \"whole\", which is more of a synonym than a comparative.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction was to write the opposite of the input. But the outputs don't show opposites—like \"This song is bad\" instead of good. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother possibility: The instruction was to summarize the input into a shorter phrase. But the outputs are longer or rephrased, not summarized.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction was to perform a translation to another language and then back, but that's probably not the case here.\n\nWait, let's look for a pattern in the outputs compared to the inputs:\n\n1. Input: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\" Here, \"fire\" is a term for something being good. The output replaces it with \"incredibly good,\" which is a more direct description.\n\n2. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\" The sentence is restructured. Instead of \"I did X\", it's \"X were done.\"\n\n3. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Again, \"whole\" → \"entire\", \"made up\" → \"fabricated.\"\n\n4. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" The verb is replaced with a synonym.\n\n5. Input: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\" Here, \"got\" is replaced with \"understood,\" and the sentence becomes simpler.\n\nSo, putting this together, the instruction might have been to perform the following steps for each input:\n\n1. Replace any informal or colloquial expressions with more formal alternatives.\n2. Adjust sentence structure where appropriate (e.g., passive voice, subject-verb inversion).\n3. Use synonyms for certain key words (e.g., \"many\" → \"various,\" \"made up\" → \"fabricated\").\n4. Expand phrases into more descriptive clauses (e.g., \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\").\n\nBut how to phrase this as a single instruction? Perhaps the instruction was: \"Rewrite each input to a more formal register by replacing informal terms with synonyms, adjusting sentence structures where necessary, and enhancing descriptive elements.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been more specific, like using a thesaurus to find synonyms for certain words and rephrasing the sentence structure. For example, if the instruction was to replace \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\" and rephrase the rest accordingly, but that seems too case-specific.\n\nWait, looking back at all the examples, maybe the instruction was to \"make the sentence more formal by using synonyms and adjusting grammar.\" That seems plausible. Because each output is a more formal version of the input. For example:\n\nInput 1: Informal slang term \"fire\" → Output uses \"incredibly good,\" which is more formal.\n\nInput 2: Changes from active to passive, which is more formal in writing.\n\nInput 3: \"Entire\" is more formal than \"whole.\"\n\nInput 4: \"Resembles\" is more formal than \"looks like.\"\n\nInput 5: \"Understood\" is a synonym but the sentence structure is simplified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to \"convert each input into a more elegant sentence by replacing informal expressions with more sophisticated vocabulary and improving sentence structure.\"\n\nThat makes sense. The outputs are all more elegant, formal versions of the inputs. So the instruction was likely: \"Rewrite each input into a more elegant sentence using more sophisticated vocabulary and proper grammar structures.\"\n\nTo confirm, let's check if each output aligns with this instruction:\n\n1. Input: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\" Using a synonym for \"fire,\" and replacing with a more descriptive phrase. More elegant.\n2. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\" Passive voice and restructuring make it more formal.\n3. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Formal synonym usage.\n4. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" More formal verb choice.\n5. Input: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\" Replacing \"got\" with \"understood,\" and the sentence becomes more concise.\n\nYes, this fits. Each output is more formal, uses synonyms, and in some cases restructures the sentence. Therefore, the instruction was likely to rewrite each input into a more elegant sentence by replacing informal expressions with more sophisticated vocabulary and improving sentence structures.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction given was to **rewrite each input into a more formal, elegant version** by:\n\n1. **Replacing informal or colloquial expressions** with **more sophisticated synonyms** (e.g., \"fire\" → \"incredibly good,\" \"made up\" → \"fabricated\").\n2. **Adjusting sentence structures** to improve formality and clarity (e.g., restructuring from active to passive voice, simplifying clauses).\n3. **Using precise synonyms** for verbs (e.g., \"considered\" → \"were considered,\" \"looks like\" → \"resembles\"), and updating pronoun placement for conciseness.\n\nBy applying these transformations, each input was converted into a more formal, refined output. \n\n**Final Instruction:**  \n\"Rewrite each input into a more elegant sentence using more sophisticated vocabulary and proper grammar structures.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

Hmm. So each input is transformed into an output, and I need to see the pattern or rule that the friend applied here.\n\nFirst, looking at the first pair: Input \"Can you do all these tasks?\" becomes \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" So the original question is about ability, and the output is phrased as a possibility or potential. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase questions into their corresponding possibilities using different verbs or structures. Like turning \"can you...\" into \"would you be able to accomplish...\"?\n\nSecond input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" turns into \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Both use \"can't\" but switch \"stand\" with \"tolerate\". Similarly, third input: \"I can't tell the difference\" becomes \"I find it hard to distinguish\". Here, the structure changes from \"can't [infinitive]\" to \"find it hard to [gerund]\".\n\nFourth input: The original sentence is a bit different. The input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So they changed \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". That seems like replacing \"me\" with the object clause \"whom\". But wait, in the output, it's \"whom\" instead of \"me\", so maybe the instruction was to convert direct objects after verbs to use \"whom\" instead? Or maybe when the verb is followed by a relative clause, change \"me\" to \"whom\". For example, in the original, \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\".\n\nFifth input: \"She looks like her sister.\" becomes \"She resembles her sister.\" So \"look like\" is replaced with \"resemble\". So maybe whenever there's a phrasal verb or idiom in the input, replace it with a synonym.\n\nPutting this all together, the instruction might be to convert certain phrases or parts of speech. Let me check again:\n\n1. First input: Changing \"can you\" to \"would you be able to accomplish\". So \"can\" (ability) is turned into \"be able to\" + infinitive. Wait, but the first input was a yes/no question, and the output is more of a possibility. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase questions into statements about ability, changing \"can you\" to \"would you be able to\". Or perhaps converting negative questions into negative statements using \"cannot\" and rephrasing.\n\nWait, but the first input is a question, the output is a statement. So maybe the instruction was to convert questions into declarative sentences by rephrasing. For example, replacing \"can you\" with \"would you be able to\" (as in the first output), and \"i can't stand\" to \"i cannot tolerate\", which is similar to changing \"can't\" to \"cannot\", and replacing \"stand\" with \"tolerate\". \n\nThird input: \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\". So \"can't\" becomes \"find it hard to\", and the verb \"tell\" is replaced with \"distinguish\". \n\nFourth input: Changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". So perhaps in cases where the subject is the object of a preposition or clause, replace \"me\" with \"whom\". But wait, in the fourth input, the structure is different: the input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the change is replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met\". That suggests that when a relative clause is present, \"met\" (past tense of meet) is changed to \"whom\" + \"met\".\n\nFifth input: \"looks like\" → \"resembles\". So replacing \"look like\" with \"resemble\".\n\nPutting all these transformations together, the instruction might be to replace specific phrases or verb structures with their synonyms or rephrased versions. Let me try to see if there's a common thread.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at each output and see how it differs from the input.\n\n1. Question to declarative. \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\" So maybe the instruction was to convert questions into their corresponding \"could/can you...\" to \"would you be able to...\" type of questions into statements. But no, the first output is not a question anymore. Wait, the first input is a question, output is a statement. So perhaps the task was to turn questions into statements by rephrasing.\n\nBut the second input is a statement, output is another statement. Third is statement to statement. Fourth is statement to statement. Fifth is statement to statement.\n\nSo maybe the general rule is to convert certain verbs or expressions into other forms. Let's see:\n\n1. For \"can you\", change to \"would you be able to accomplish\". So \"can\" (ability) is turned into \"be able to\" + verb. But in the output, the structure is \"Would you be able to [verb]?\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to convert negative questions into negative statements. But the first input isn't negative. Wait, the second input is \"I can't stand...\", output is \"I cannot tolerate...\". So \"can't\" (negative) becomes \"cannot\" (same), but \"stand\" is replaced with \"tolerate\".\n\nThird input: \"can't tell\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\". \"Find it hard\" vs. \"can't tell\". So \"can't\" becomes \"it is hard\" or \"have difficulty\". \n\nFourth input: changing \"met\" to \"whom I met\". That's more like replacing \"me\" with \"whom\" when it's part of a relative clause. Because \"I met\" is the subject, but after changing to \"whom\", it's the object. So maybe the instruction was to convert direct objects to indirect objects, but that's not exactly clear.\n\nFifth input: replacing \"look like\" with \"resemble\".\n\nHmm. So the patterns are varied. Let's list the transformations again:\n\n1. \"can you\" → \"would you be able to accomplish\" – possibly rephrasing ability as potential.\n2. \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" – same negative structure, but different verb.\n3. \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\" – changing \"can't\" to \"hard to\" + gerund.\n4. \"met yesterday\" → \"whom I met yesterday\" – changing \"met\" to \"whom I met\".\n5. \"looks like\" → \"resembles\" – replacing phrasal verb with a synonym.\n\nIs there a common theme here? Maybe the instruction was to convert various expressions into their more formal or alternative phrasing. For example:\n\n- For questions: rephrase \"can you\" into \"would you be able to accomplish\".\n- For \"can't\" + verb: replace with \"cannot\" + infinitive and change the verb if needed (e.g., \"stand\" → \"tolerate\").\n- For inability to perceive: \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n- For past tense of \"meet\": \"met\" → \"whom I met\" (using a relative pronoun).\n- For \"look like\": replace with \"resemble\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert imperatives into questions or something else, but the examples don't fit that.\n\nWait, let's think about possible instruction types. The outputs seem to be various transformations. Perhaps the original instruction was to \"convert each input into its antonym or paraphrase\" but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, the instruction could be to perform certain grammatical conversions:\n\n- Replace \"me\" with \"whom\" when following a preposition or clause.\n- Replace \"can't\" with \"cannot\" and adjust the following verb.\n- Replace \"look like\" with \"resemble\".\n- Change \"can you\" to \"would you be able to\".\n- Change \"I met\" to \"whom I met\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to \"replace certain verbs or phrases with their synonyms or rephrased equivalents,\" but that's too vague.\n\nLooking back at the fifth input: \"She looks like her sister.\" Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" So \"look like\" is replaced with \"resemble\".\n\nAnother thought: The instruction might be to replace \"me\" with \"whom\" in cases where the subject is the object of a verb or clause. For example, in the fourth input, \"I met\" is replaced with \"whom I met\". But why? If the instruction was to convert direct objects to indirect objects, but \"me\" is already the object. Wait, \"I met\" is the subject. Wait, no, the original sentence is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" So \"I met\" is the subject. Then the output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the change is adding \"whom\". So perhaps in any case where the subject of the main clause is the object of a preposition or clause, convert \"I\" to \"whom\"?\n\nWait, no. Because in the fourth input, there's no preposition before \"met\". It's \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" So \"I met\" is the subject. Changing it to \"whom I met\". So maybe whenever \"me\" is used as a subject after a preposition or clause, replace it with \"whom\". But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace \"me\" with \"who\" or \"whom\" in relative clauses. Let's see:\n\nIn the fourth input: \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\". So the original is \"I met [someone] yesterday\", and the output is \"whom I met\". So that seems like converting \"I met [someone]\" to \"[someone] whom I met\". But why? Maybe when the relative clause starts with \"I\", replace it with \"whom\"? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to convert direct objects to indirect objects. For example, \"I met [someone]\" becomes \"I met [someone] who I found helpful\", but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps the instruction was to change the possessive from \"my\" to \"my own\" or something. But the inputs don't have possessives.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the outputs, the fifth one replaces \"look like\" with \"resemble\". So that's a direct synonym replacement. Similarly, \"can't tell\" becomes \"find it hard\", which is a paraphrase.\n\nSo maybe the instruction was to replace certain collocations or phrases with their synonyms or paraphrases. Let's check:\n\n1. \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\"\n   - This seems like a rephrasing rather than a direct synonym. Perhaps converting questions into statements about capability.\n2. \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" – same structure (negative), different verb.\n3. \"can't tell\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\" – changing \"can't\" to \"hard to\" plus gerund.\n4. \"met yesterday\" → \"whom I met yesterday\" – changing \"met\" to \"whom I met\" – perhaps converting the subject of \"met\" to an object with \"whom\".\n5. \"looks like\" → \"resembles\" – direct synonym.\n\nSo the instruction might be a combination of multiple transformations. However, the problem is that the instruction should be a single rule that applies to all inputs. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input by converting certain phrases or verbs into others while maintaining the sentence structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to perform a series of transformations, like:\n\n- Replace \"can you\" with \"are you capable of\".\n- Replace \"can't stand\" with \"refuse to tolerate\".\n- Replace \"can't tell the difference\" with \"have difficulty distinguishing\".\n- Replace \"met\" with \"had met\" and add \"whom\".\n- Replace \"look like\" with \"resemble\".\n\nBut that's too ad-hoc. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction was to convert questions into their corresponding \"could you\" structure. But the first output is a statement, not a question. Hmm.\n\nWait, the first input is a question: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" The output is \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" So maybe the instruction was to rephrase questions into statements by adding \"would\" and \"be able to\". But then, why does the second input, which is a statement, also follow the same structure? Let's check:\n\nOriginal 2: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" So \"can't\" is replaced with \"cannot\", but the verb changes from \"stand\" to \"tolerate\". So maybe the instruction was to replace \"can't\" with \"cannot\" and change the verb to its synonym. But in the first output, the structure changes more significantly.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to convert questions into statements by changing \"can you\" to \"would you be able to\". But the second input is a statement, so applying the same transformation would require changing \"can't\" to \"couldn't\", but the output uses \"cannot\". So that's inconsistent.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's try to see if there's a common element across all outputs. Each output seems to involve some form of restructuring:\n\n1. Rephrasing questions into statements with modal verbs.\n2. Changing \"can't\" to \"cannot\" and adjusting the following verb.\n3. Changing \"can't tell\" to \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n4. Adding \"whom\" to \"I met\" in a relative clause.\n5. Replacing \"look like\" with \"resemble\".\n\nMaybe the instruction was to perform specific grammatical transformations or vocabulary substitutions for certain phrases. For example:\n\n- When \"can you\" appears, rephrase as \"would you be able to\".\n- When \"can't\" followed by a verb, replace with \"cannot\" and change the verb if it's a common synonym.\n- When \"can't tell the difference\", rephrase as \"have difficulty distinguishing\".\n- When \"met\" in a past tense followed by a relative clause (like \"I met\"), change to \"whom I met\".\n- When \"look like\", replace with \"resemble\".\n\nBut how to tie all these into a single instruction? Perhaps the original instruction was a set of rules or tasks to apply to each input. However, the user mentioned that the friend followed an instruction, implying a single rule or process.\n\nAnother possibility: The instruction was to translate the input into more formal English. For example, using more formal phrasing where appropriate.\n\nLet's look at each input-output pair under this lens:\n\n1. \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\" – formalizing the request for capability.\n2. \"I can't stand...\" → \"I cannot tolerate...\" – more formal, changing \"can't\" to \"cannot\" and replacing \"stand\" with \"tolerate\".\n3. \"I can't tell...\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish...\" – formalizing and rephrasing inability to perceive differences.\n4. \"The lawyer I met yesterday...\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday...\" – perhaps formalizing by using \"whom\" in a relative clause.\n5. \"She looks like her sister.\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" – replacing informal expression with a more formal synonym.\n\nIf the instruction was to make the language more formal, that could explain the transformations. For example, replacing colloquialisms with formal terms, changing \"can you\" to \"would you be able to\", replacing \"can't\" with \"cannot\", etc.\n\nTesting this hypothesis: All outputs seem more formal than the inputs. The first input is a casual question, output is formal. Second input uses \"can't\", output uses \"cannot\". Third input uses \"can't tell\", output uses \"find it hard to distinguish\". Fourth input uses colloquial \"I met\", output uses \"whom I met\". Fifth input uses \"look like\", output uses \"resemble\". So yes, all outputs appear more formal.\n\nTherefore, the instruction was likely to rewrite each input into more formal English by replacing certain informal expressions with their more formal counterparts. This could include changing \"can you\" to \"are you able to\", \"can't\" to \"cannot\", replacing \"look like\" with \"resemble\", changing \"I met\" to \"I had met\" (but in the output it's \"whom I met\"), and modifying relative clauses by replacing \"me\" with \"whom\".\n\nWait, but the fourth input's transformation was changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". If the instruction was to make the language more formal, perhaps the advice was to use \"whom\" where possible. So in the case of relative clauses where \"me\" is the object, use \"whom\". For example, \"I met him\" → \"he whom I met\".\n\nBut in the fourth input, the original is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". So whenever the subject of the main clause is the object of a preposition or relative clause, replace \"I\" with \"whom\".\n\nThat's a specific grammar rule: Use \"whom\" instead of \"I\" when the subject of the main clause is the object of a relative clause. For example, \"I saw the man who I met yesterday\" would become \"The man whom I met yesterday\".\n\nSo the instruction might have been to apply this grammatical rule whenever applicable. Let's check the inputs:\n\nFourth input: The original is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" According to the rule, since \"I met\" is the subject of the main clause, but in the relative clause \"I met yesterday\", \"I\" is the subject. So changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" would make it \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" That fits.\n\nSo the instruction could be to correct the use of \"I\" in relative clauses by replacing it with \"whom\" when the subject of the main clause is the object of the relative clause.\n\nBut does this apply to all cases? Let's see:\n\nIn the fourth input, the main clause subject is \"The lawyer\", and the relative clause is \"I met yesterday\". The \"I\" in the relative clause is the subject, so replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" gives \"whom I met\". That seems correct. So the instruction might be: In any relative clause where \"I\" is the subject, replace it with \"whom\".\n\nTherefore, the instruction was to convert instances where \"I\" is the subject of a relative clause to \"whom\", thereby making the language more formal and grammatically correct.\n\nThis aligns with the fourth input's transformation. Let's verify other inputs:\n\nFirst input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" – doesn't involve a relative clause, so irrelevant here.\n\nSecond input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" No relative clause, so irrelevant.\n\nThird input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" Again, no relative clause.\n\nFifth input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" No relative clause.\n\nTherefore, only the fourth input follows this rule, which suggests that the primary instruction was to fix the",

Hmm, each input seems to be transformed into the output by replacing certain words or adjusting the structure slightly. Let me start by listing out the examples again:\n\n1. Input: She looks like her sister. Output: She resembles her sister.\n2. Input: The whole story was made up. Output: The entire story was fabricated.\n3. Input: The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful. Output: The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\n4. Input: This song is fire. Output: This song is incredibly good.\n5. Input: Thanks for your help. Output: Your assistance is much appreciated.\n\nLooking at these, there are different types of transformations happening here. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nFirst example: \"looks like\" changed to \"resembles\". So maybe the instruction is to replace \"look like\" with \"resemble\"? But wait, the second input was \"whole story made up\", which becomes \"entire story fabricated\". So \"whole\" to \"entire\", \"made up\" to \"fabricated\". That seems like replacing the adjective \"whole\" with \"entire\", but maybe the actual transformation here is substituting a more formal synonym? Because \"made up\" is a phrasal verb meaning fabricated, so maybe replacing the adjective with a more formal noun phrase?\n\nThird input: \"I met yesterday\" turned into \"whom I met yesterday\". Oh, that's changing the pronoun from \"I\" to \"whom\". Wait, but in the original, it's written as \"I met\", but the output uses \"whom\". Wait, no—the input says \"I met yesterday was helpful\", and the output says \"the lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the input didn't have a relative clause. Wait, no—wait the original input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the difference here is the use of \"whom\" instead of \"I\". That suggests that the instruction is to change \"I\" to \"whom\" when it's the object of a preposition. But only in cases where the preposition is followed by a clause that refers back to the subject? Wait, maybe the instruction is about replacing the subjective \"I\" with the objective \"me\" or \"whom\"? But in the third example, the output uses \"whom\". Hmm. Let me check the original sentence structure. The input is \"The lawyer [I met yesterday] was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer [whom I met yesterday] was helpful.\" So the replacement is changing \"I\" to \"whom\". So maybe the instruction was to replace any instance of \"I\" that is the subject of a clause introduced by a preposition (like \"met\") with \"whom\". Because in this case, \"met\" is a verb followed by an indirect object (\"I\") or a direct object with a prepositional phrase. Wait, maybe the instruction was to convert possessive \"I\" to \"me\" or \"whom\"? But here it's replaced with \"whom\". Alternatively, perhaps the instruction was to convert any \"I\" to \"whom\" when it's the object of a preposition. Let me think: \"I met yesterday\" is part of the relative clause modifying \"lawyer\". So the structure is \"the lawyer [relative clause] was helpful\". The relative clause could be \"who I met yesterday\" or \"whom I met yesterday\". So the instruction might be to replace \"who\" with \"whom\" in relative clauses. But in the input, there's no \"who\", just \"I met yesterday\". So replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" when it's the object of the verb \"met\". Hmm, maybe the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"me\" when it's the object of a preposition? Or in this specific context, converting \"I\" to \"whom\".\n\nFourth example: \"is fire\" becomes \"is incredibly good\". So \"fire\" is slang for \"amazingly good\". So perhaps the instruction was to replace \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\". But why in the fourth input and not the first? Wait, the first input had \"looks like\" replaced with \"resembles\", which isn't slang. Wait, the second input was \"made up\" replaced with \"fabricated\", which is more formal. The third input replaced \"I\" with \"whom\". The fourth replaced \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\". The fifth replaced \"Thanks\" with \"Your assistance is much appreciated\". So maybe the instruction is to perform multiple types of transformations. But that would be inconsistent if each input required a different type of transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more polite or formal version. Let's look at the fifth example: \"Thanks for your help\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" So here, they're converting \"thanks\" into a more formal expression. Similarly, the third input is changing \"I\" to \"whom\", which might be a formalization. The second example replaces \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\"—both more formal terms. The first example replaces \"looks like\" with \"resembles\"—also a synonym. The fourth example replaces slang with a more positive expression. \n\nSo maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version. But how do all these examples fit under that umbrella? Let's see:\n\n- Formalizing: Replace informal phrasing with formal terms (e.g., \"whole\"→\"entire\", \"made up\"→\"fabricated\").\n- Converting pronouns: Changing \"I\" to \"me\" or \"whom\" (third example).\n- Replacing slangs/phrases with more standard expressions (e.g., \"fire\"→\"incredibly good\").\n- Rephrasing gratitude (\"Thanks for your help\"→\"Your assistance is much appreciated\").\n\nBut how can a single instruction encompass all these varied transformations? Maybe the instruction was to convert each sentence into a more formal, polite, or standard version. However, each input-output pair requires different types of changes, which complicates things. For example, the first input is a simple synonym substitution, the second is changing parts of speech and phrasing, the third involves grammatical structure (subject to object), the fourth slang to praise, fifth gratitude to formality.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the instruction is about making each sentence more precise or accurate. For example, replacing \"looks like\" with \"resembles\" (maybe because \"resemble\" is more accurate than \"look like\"). The second example \"made up\" being changed to \"fabricated\" perhaps to clarify the meaning better. The third example using \"whom\" instead of \"I\" might be to make the sentence structure more grammatically correct (though \"whom\" is sometimes used where \"who\" would suffice, depending on style). The fourth example replacing colloquialism with praise, and the fifth turning thanks into a more formal compliment.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to translate the input into a more formal tone, possibly by replacing contractions, using more formal verbs, adjusting pronouns, etc. But how to reconcile all the examples under one instruction?\n\nWait, looking at the third example again: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful\". Here, the instruction could be to change the reflexive pronoun from \"me\" to \"myself\" or adjust the pronoun in the relative clause. But in this case, it's changing \"I\" to \"whom\". So perhaps the instruction is to replace any instance of \"I\" with \"me\" or \"myself\", but only in specific contexts. Wait, in the third example, the structure is \"The lawyer [I met yesterday] was helpful\". So the \"I\" is the direct object of the verb \"met\". Therefore, replacing \"I\" with \"me\" would make sense. But the output uses \"whom\". Hmm, \"whom\" is the objective case used as the object of a preposition. Wait, but in this case, \"met\" is followed by an indirect object \"I\". If we wanted to convert the indirect object to the objective case, we would say \"whom\". So maybe the instruction was to replace the direct object \"I\" with \"me\" or the indirect object with \"whom\". But in this case, \"I\" is the indirect object. Let me check: \"I met\" as a verb phrase. The structure is \"verb (met) [indirect object] (I)\". So in some contexts, when converting indirect objects to the objective case, you use \"me\". But here, the output uses \"whom\", which is even more formal. So perhaps the instruction was to change the indirect object \"I\" to \"me\" when followed by a preposition. Wait, but there's no preposition here. The preposition comes after \"met\"—wait, no, \"met\" is the verb, and \"yesterday\" is an adverb. So maybe the instruction is to replace the indirect object \"I\" with \"me\", but in this case, the indirect object is \"I\", so changing to \"me\" would make it \"The lawyer me met yesterday was helpful\", which doesn't parse. Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps the third example is not about changing indirect objects but about restructuring the relative clause.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to change the relative pronoun from \"who\" to \"whom\". In the original input, the clause is \"I met yesterday\", and the output is \"whom I met yesterday\". So replacing \"who\" with \"whom\". But in the input, there's no \"who\"—it's \"I met yesterday\". So how did that happen? Maybe the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in certain relative clauses. But the logic is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to convert the entire sentence into a formalized version by replacing \"I\" with \"me\" and changing other parts accordingly. But in the third example, that would require changing \"I met\" to \"me met\", which doesn't make sense. So that approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, maybe the instruction is to make the sentence more grammatically correct. For example, changing \"She looks like her sister\" to \"She resembles her sister\" because \"resemble\" is more accurate than \"look like\" when comparing people. Then \"The whole story was made up\" to \"The entire story was fabricated\" because \"fabricated\" is a more precise term for a lie. The third example might be converting \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" because it's a more formal relative clause construction. The fourth input, \"This song is fire\", changed to \"is incredibly good\" as a way of saying the song is great without using slang. The fifth input, \"Thanks for your help\" converted to \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" which is a more formal way of expressing gratitude.\n\nSo, the instruction could be to rephrase each input into a more formal or precise version, adjusting wording, structure, and grammar accordingly. However, each example requires different transformations. For instance, the third example changes the pronoun to \"whom\", the fifth example converts \"thanks\" to a longer phrase, while others involve synonyms or phrasing adjustments.\n\nBut how to connect all these under one instruction? Maybe the key is that all these transformations aim to make the sentences more formal, precise, or polite. So the instruction was something like: \"Rephrase each sentence into a more formal, polite, or precise version by replacing informal phrases, adjusting pronouns, choosing more accurate vocabulary, or restructuring the sentence.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was more specific. For example, \"Replace 'I' with 'me' when it follows a verb\" for the third example. But then why does the fifth example involve gratitude?\n\nAlternatively, considering the fifth example, \"Thanks for your help\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" This is a common way to rephrase thanks into a more formal response. Maybe the instruction was to turn gratitude expressions into more elaborate or formal ones. But the third example is about changing \"I\" to \"whom\".\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to convert each sentence into a more positive tone, like replacing negative or less positive expressions with more positive ones. But the first example replaces \"looks like\" with \"resembles\", which isn't necessarily positive. The second example is more formal. The fifth example is definitely positive. So that might not fit.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, they seem to vary in terms of what's transformed. Maybe the original instruction wasn't singular but had multiple components. For example, the instruction might have been a combination of tasks, like:\n\n1. Replace \"I\" with \"me\" when it follows a verb.\n2. Convert phrasal verbs like \"made up\" to their more formal counterparts.\n3. Replace colloquial expressions with more precise synonyms.\n4. Restructure sentences with relative clauses to improve grammar or formality.\n\nBut how can we distill this into a single instruction that encompasses all these? Maybe the instruction was to \"Rephrase each sentence into a more formal or precise version by adjusting pronouns, replacing informal terms, selecting appropriate synonyms, and improving sentence structure.\" But is that too vague?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the examples again:\n\n1. \"She looks like her sister\" → \"resembles\" (synonym).\n2. \"whole story made up\" → \"entire story fabricated\" (more formal nouns).\n3. \"I met yesterday\" → \"whom I met\" (change pronoun from subject to object).\n4. \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\" (replacing slang with praise).\n5. \"Thanks\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" (rephrasing gratitude).\n\nThe common thread here is that each input is being transformed into a more formal, polite, or precise version. The third example specifically uses \"whom\" which is more formal. The fifth example turns a casual \"thanks\" into a more elaborate phrase. The first and second examples use synonyms and more formal terminology. The fourth example replaces slang with a more positive description.\n\nGiven all this, the most likely instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version. However, considering the specific transformations, another possibility is that the instruction was to convert the first person perspective into third person or adjust pronouns. For example, the third example changes \"I\" to \"whom\", which is part of a relative clause. But why \"whom\" instead of \"me\"?\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to convert each sentence into a more formal style, which can include various adjustments: replacing contractions with full forms, using more precise verbs, adjusting punctuation, or restructuring clauses for clarity. However, the third example seems to be a more specific change in pronoun case.\n\nWait, but in the third example, the original is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the change is \"I\" to \"whom\". This suggests that the instruction was to change the direct object \"I\" to \"me\", but since \"me\" doesn't fit here (as it would require changing the sentence structure), perhaps the instruction was to change the indirect object \"I\" to \"me\" or the subject of a past participle verb to \"me\". Wait, in this case, \"met\" is the verb, and \"yesterday\" is the time. So \"I met\" is the past tense of \"meet\" with indirect object \"I\". If we replace \"I\" with \"me\", it would be \"me met yesterday\", which is grammatically incorrect. So perhaps the instruction was to change the indirect object to \"me\" when it's preceded by a preposition. But there's no preposition here.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to see if there's a pattern across all examples. Each input is a short sentence, and the output is a slightly altered version. The variations are in synonyms, formalization, pronoun changes, phrasing adjustments, and expanding phrases. To cover all these, the instruction must be quite broad. The key is that each transformation aims to make the sentence more formal, precise, or polite.\n\nBut the third example is the only one that explicitly changes a pronoun from subject to object (\"I\"→\"whom\"), which is a stylistic choice. The other examples don't involve pronoun changes except the fifth, which turns \"your help\" into \"assistance\".\n\nAnother angle: maybe the instruction was to translate each sentence into a more formal style, which could include adjusting vocabulary, rephrasing, and restructuring. The fact that some examples use synonyms, others use more formal terms, and others change grammatical structures supports this idea.\n\nPutting it all together, the most plausible instruction is: \"Rewrite each sentence into a more formal or precise version by replacing informal expressions, adjusting word choices, rephrasing, and/or restructuring the sentence as needed.\" This instruction would allow for the variety of transformations observed in the input-output pairs.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input sentence into a more formal or precise version** by adjusting vocabulary, grammar, or phrasing as needed. This involved various transformations such as:\n- Replacing informal phrasing with formal terms (e.g., \"whole\" → \"entire\", \"made up\" → \"fabricated\").\n- Synonym substitutions (e.g., \"looks like\" → \"resembles\").\n- Grammatical corrections (e.g., changing \"I\" to \"whom\" in relative clauses).\n- Polishing expressions (e.g., \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\", \"Thanks\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated\").\n\n**Final Instruction:**  \n\"Rewrite each sentence into a more formal or precise version by refining word choices, adjusting grammar, and enhancing clarity as needed.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

Hmm. So the friend took five different inputs and for each, produced an output. Let me look at each pair and see if I can spot a pattern or transformation rule.\n\nFirst, Input 1 was \"Thanks for your help.\" and Output 1 was \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Wait, but actually, if we parse the output, maybe it's more like \"You [help]\" -> \"Your assistance is much appreciated\". So perhaps the original instruction was to rephrase the sentence into a more formal or slightly different structure? But let me check other examples.\n\nSecond input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" Oh, here the original uses \"can't tell the difference\" which is changed to \"find it hard to distinguish\". So \"can't tell\" becomes \"find it hard\", which might be a common phrasing in certain styles. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase using \"find it hard to [verb]\"?\n\nThird input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" So here, the output replaces \"got what you said\" with \"understood you\". So maybe the task is to convert the original statement into a more concise or direct statement of understanding? Or perhaps replace \"got\" with \"understood\".\n\nFourth input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" Here, the original is a negative statement about not thinking it's a good idea, and the output is phrased as a suggestion (suggested) that no action should be taken. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the original into a suggestion or proposal, possibly in passive voice?\n\nFifth input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" So here, the output adds \"my opinion that\" instead of just \"I think\". Maybe the task is to phrase the statement as an opinion rather than a personal thought?\n\nSo putting all these transformations together, what's the common thread? Let's see:\n\n1. From \"Thanks for your help.\" to \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" - Maybe converting gratitude into more formal language, or changing \"thanks\" to \"appreciate\".\n\n2. From \"can't tell the difference\" to \"find it hard\". This seems like a change in phrasing. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase using \"find it hard to [verb] instead of 'can't tell the difference' or similar expressions.\n\n3. \"Got what you said\" to \"understood you\". Replacing \"got\" with \"understood\" and adjusting the structure slightly.\n\n4. \"We don't think it's a good idea...\" to \"It is suggested...\". So turning a negative statement into a positive suggestion, possibly using passive voice (\"should be taken\") and phrasing as a recommendation.\n\n5. \"I think that this is interesting\" to \"It is my opinion...\". Changing \"I think\" to \"it is my opinion\" and removing the \"that\".\n\nSo, trying to see if there's a common rule here. Let's list possible instruction possibilities:\n\n- Convert the original statements into more formal, polite language, possibly in certain contexts (like business communication).\n- Replace first-person phrases with third-person or more general terms.\n- Restructure sentences into more indirect or formal phrasing.\n- Turn opinions into stated opinions (like \"I think\" becomes \"my opinion\").\n- Change \"can't tell the difference\" type phrases to \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n- Adjust negations into suggestions or recommendations.\n\nWait, but looking at example 4: the original is a negative (\"don't think it's a good idea\"), and the output is a positive suggestion. That seems like a significant shift. Similarly, example 5: changing \"I think\" to \"it is my opinion\". So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal, objective statement, often in a professional context where such phrasing is expected.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal version, sometimes using different structures. For example, converting subjective thoughts into stated opinions, changing \"can't tell\" to \"find it hard\", etc.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the outputs. They seem to use more passive voice or reported speech constructions. For example, the fourth output uses \"should be taken\" (passive), and the fifth uses \"it is my opinion\" (passive construction). The first output uses \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" which is more formal than the original. The second uses \"find it hard to distinguish\", which is a bit more formal than \"can't tell\".\n\nHmm. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or professional style, sometimes rephrasing entire sentences or parts of them. For instance, converting casual \"don't think\" into a suggestion, replacing \"I think\" with \"it is my opinion\", rephrasing \"can't tell the difference\" as \"find it hard to distinguish\", adjusting subject pronouns where needed, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate each input into a specific style guide's requirement, like AP style or another journalistic format, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's consider each output's structure compared to the input:\n\n1. Original: \"Thanks for your help.\" -> Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n\n   The output is more of a response thanking them back, whereas the input was a direct thanks. So maybe the instruction was to turn the input into a more formal or reciprocating response. But the second input also seems to have that kind of reciprocity, but the fourth input's output is a suggestion rather than a response.\n\nBut in the first case, the input is a direct thank you, and the output is a more formal way of expressing the same thing. So perhaps the instruction was to convert the input into a more formal or polite expression, maintaining the essence of the message but phrased differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to use a particular translation or phrasing, like replacing \"can't tell\" with \"find it hard\", \"I got\" with \"understood\", etc., as seen in some of the examples.\n\nAnother approach: Look for patterns in the transformation steps.\n\nFor example, input 1: \"Thanks for your help.\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" The original is someone thanking the speaker for their help. The output is a more formal way of expressing gratitude. The key change is \"thanks for your help\" -> \"your assistance is much appreciated\". So the output is a longer phrase expressing the same idea but more formally.\n\nSimilarly, input 2: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" becomes \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" So the original uses \"can't tell the difference\", which is converted to \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n\nInput 3: \"I got what you said.\" -> \"I understood you.\" So \"got what you said\" becomes \"understood you\", which is more direct.\n\nInput 4: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" -> \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" The original is a negative statement; the output is a positive suggestion, phrased as a recommendation.\n\nInput 5: \"I think that this is interesting.\" -> \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" So \"I think\" is replaced with \"it is my opinion\".\n\nPutting this all together, the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more formal or professional tone, often rephrasing entire sentences, using different verbs (e.g., \"can't tell\" to \"find hard\"), adjusting sentence structure (like turning \"we don't think\" into \"it is suggested\"), replacing \"I think\" with \"my opinion\", and generally making the phrasing more measured or indirect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to follow a specific set of rules for each input type. For example:\n\n- If the input starts with a gratitude expression, output a more formal version of thanks.\n- If the input expresses difficulty, rephrase using \"find it hard to\".\n- If the input is a first-person understanding, rephrase as \"you understand\".\n- If the input is a negative about taking action, rephrase into a suggestion not to take any action.\n- If the input is a personal opinion, rephrase as \"it is my opinion\".\n\nBut that seems a bit fragmented. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction was to apply a transformation rule that converts the input into a statement that's either a response (like thanking back), a suggestion, an opinion, etc., based on the content.\n\nLooking at the fourth input, the output is a suggestion, which wasn't present in the input. The original was a statement of lack of interest in taking action. So the instruction may have required converting certain types of statements into suggestions or recommendations.\n\nIn that case, maybe the instruction was something like: \"For each input, rephrase it into a formal statement appropriate for a professional context, such as replacing personal opinions with statements of fact expressed as recommendations or suggestions.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to apply certain translation rules, like replacing \"can't tell\" with \"find it hard\", \"I got\" with \"understood\", etc.\n\nWait, looking at the first output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" vs the original \"Thanks for your help.\" So the output is a response to the input, thanking the speaker in a more formal way. But in the second input, the output is also a response. However, the fourth input is not a request for help but a statement, whose output is a suggestion. So perhaps the instruction was to turn each input into a form of response or recommendation, depending on the context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to convert the input into a statement that would be considered polite or professional in a certain setting, regardless of the original purpose. For example, turning a simple statement into a more formalized version, possibly adding \"I\" statements or using different verbs.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the outputs, several use \"is suggested\" or \"my opinion\". The fourth example's output is a good example of that. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a suggestion (if it relates to avoiding action) or an opinion (for the fifth input).\n\nBut how to connect all these transformations under a single instruction. Perhaps the original instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or objective statement, possibly using passive voice or phrasing that reflects professional communication, while maintaining the original meaning.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been: \"For each input, generate a response that restates the input in a more formal or indirect manner, possibly using different vocabulary or sentence structures, ensuring clarity and appropriateness for a professional audience.\"\n\nThis would cover various aspects like transforming \"can't tell\" into \"find it hard\", \"got what you said\" to \"understood\", negative about action to suggestion, and personal opinions to statements of opinion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was specifically to translate each input into a set of target phrases:\n\n- Gratitude (\"Thanks...\") → \"Your assistance... is much appreciated.\"\n- Difficulty in distinguishing → \"I find it hard...\"\n- Understanding → \"I understood...\"/\"You understood...\"\n- Negative on action → Suggestion not to take action.\n- Personal opinion → \"My opinion that...\"\n\nBut without knowing the exact instruction, it's challenging. However, considering that the outputs seem to systematically replace certain phrases or restructure sentences according to specific rules, the instruction likely involved applying a set of transformation rules to each input.\n\nGiven that, the instruction could be phrased as follows: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal or indirect statement, replacing informal expressions with more polite alternatives, restructuring sentences as needed to enhance clarity and professionalism.\"\n\nAlternatively, it could be a more specific instruction tailored to the examples given. For instance, \"Convert the following statements into a more formal response, adjusting verb phrases and sentence structure accordingly.\" \n\nBut given that all the outputs follow a pattern of either restating in a formal way, rephrasing difficultly, expressing understanding, suggesting inaction when negative on action, or phrasing opinions as \"my opinion\", the most comprehensive instruction would be to rephrase each input into a more formal or indirect statement, possibly adjusting sentence structure, verb usage, and adding phrases like \"I find it hard to,\" \"It is suggested that,\" \"My opinion that,\" or similar, depending on the input's context.\n\nTherefore, the instruction likely was something along the lines of: \"For each input, rephrase it into a more formal or indirect statement that is appropriate for a professional context, adjusting verb phrases, sentence structure, and using suitable connectors as needed.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe original instruction was likely to rephrase each input into a **more formal or indirect statement**, emphasizing clarity and professionalism. This involved applying specific transformation rules to adjust verb phrases, sentence structure, and terminology as follows:\n\n### Key Instructions:\n1. **Gratitude/Response**: Convert direct thanks into formal responses.  \n   *Example*: \"Thanks for your help.\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n\n2. **Difficulty in Differentiating**: Replace \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish.\"  \n   *Example*: \"I can't tell the difference...\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish...\"\n\n3. **Understanding**: Rephrase \"got what you said\" to convey comprehension directly.  \n   *Example*: \"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\"\n\n4. **Suggesting Inaction**: Transform negative statements about inaction into neutral recommendations.  \n   *Example*: \"We don't think...\" → \"It is suggested that no action should be taken...\"\n\n5. **Expressing Opinions**: Replace \"I think\" with \"My opinion that\" to frame statements as subjective beliefs.  \n   *Example*: \"I think...\" → \"It is my opinion that...\"\n\n### Final Instruction Statement:\n\"**Rephrase each input into a more formal or indirect statement, adjusting verb phrases, sentence structure, and using suitable connectors like \"find it hard to,\" \"it is suggested that,\" or \"my opinion that\" as needed to enhance clarity and appropriateness for professional communication.**\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

So, there are five input-output pairs, and each time the output seems to be a rephrased version of the input, but with some specific changes or transformations. My job is to find out what the original instruction was that the friend used to generate these outputs.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze each pair to see if there's a common pattern or transformation that applies to all of them. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with the first input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" The output is \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" Hmm. Comparing these two sentences, the original uses \"I think\" followed by \"that this is interesting\". The output starts with \"It is my opinion that...\" So the instruction here might involve replacing \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion that\", but only in cases where the original sentence starts with \"I think\". But wait, maybe there's more to it. Because the second input is similar. Let's check the second pair.\n\nInput 2: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" So the original uses \"I got what you said\", which is a more informal way of saying \"I understood you\". The output is a more formal version. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase informal expressions into more formal ones. But then looking at the third input:\n\nInput 3: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" Here, the original is a statement of a group's opinion (\"we don't think\"), and the output is phrased as a suggestion (\"it is suggested\"). So maybe the instruction involves transforming opinions into suggestions. But how does this fit with the other examples?\n\nWait, maybe there's a mix here. Let me look at all the outputs again. For example, the first output is adding \"It is my opinion that...\", the second is replacing \"I got what you said\" with \"I understood you\" (formalizing), third is changing \"we don't think\" into \"it is suggested\", fourth is changing \"Can you...\" into \"Would you be able to...\", and fifth is replacing \"She looks like\" with \"She resembles\".\n\nHmm. So different transformations. Let's break them down:\n\n1. Input starts with \"I think...\" → Output starts with \"It is my opinion...\"\n   So maybe the instruction was to replace \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion that...\" when the speaker is presenting their own view. But not all \"I think\" would trigger this. For example, if someone says \"I think it's true,\" maybe the output would start with \"I believe that it's true.\"\n\nBut in the given example, the first output does exactly that. So maybe the rule is to replace \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion that\" only in certain contexts. Or perhaps the rule is more general, but the examples provided are specific instances.\n\n2. \"I got what you said.\" becomes \"I understood you.\" This seems like replacing \"got\" with \"understood\" and adjusting the structure. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase \"I got\" as \"I understood\".\n\n3. \"We don't think...\" becomes \"It is suggested...\". Here, the original is a negative statement of opinion, and the output is a positive suggestion. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase negative opinions into positive suggestions.\n\n4. \"Can you do...\" becomes \"Would you be able to...\". Changing \"can\" to \"would be able to\" makes the question less assertive and more polite, maybe. So the instruction could be to make questions more polite or formal by using \"would you be able to\".\n\n5. \"She looks like her sister.\" becomes \"She resembles her sister.\" So replacing \"looks like\" with \"resembles\" to be more formal.\n\nSo putting all these together, the instruction likely involves rephrasing the input in a more formal or polite tone. But let's check if there's a common element across all transformations.\n\nLooking at the first transformation: \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion\". This could be considered a more formal way of stating an opinion. Similarly, \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\" is formalizing. \"We don't think...\" → \"It is suggested...\" is turning a negative opinion into a positive suggestion. \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\" is making the request more polite. \"She looks like...\" → \"She resembles...\" is using a more formal term.\n\nSo the instruction might be to rewrite the inputs in a more formal or polite style, possibly converting first-person statements into third-person or more indirect expressions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert certain expressions into their formal equivalents. For example, informal phrases to formal ones, or converting opinions into suggestions.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they seem to have a more passive or indirect structure. For instance, the third output uses \"it is suggested that\", which is a passive construction. The first output uses \"my opinion that\". The fifth uses \"resembles\", which is a bit more formal than \"looks like\".\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to rephrase in the subjunctive mood? Not sure. Let's check the examples:\n\nOriginal: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" So the verb changes from \"do\" to \"be able to accomplish\". That's adding \"be able to\" after the subject. Wait, the structure here is \"Can you X?\" → \"Would you be able to X?\" So the structure changes from \"Can [Subject] X?\" to \"Would [Subject] be able to X?\"\n\nThat seems like a transformation to make the question more polite. So perhaps the instruction was to turn direct questions into more polite ones by adding \"Would you be able to\".\n\nIn that case, let's check if all outputs fit this pattern.\n\nFirst input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" Doesn't fit the \"Would you...\" pattern. So maybe that's not the only rule.\n\nSecond input: \"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\" Again, not matching \"Would you...\" but formalizing \"got\".\n\nThird input: \"We don't think...\" → \"It is suggested...\" Not \"Would you...\" but rephrasing opinion.\n\nFourth input: \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\". Fits the \"Would you...\" pattern.\n\nFifth input: \"She looks like...\" → \"She resembles...\". Not \"Would you...\", but more formal.\n\nSo perhaps there are multiple rules involved. Let's list possible transformations based on the examples:\n\n1. Replace \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion that\".\n2. Formalize \"I got what you said\" to \"I understood you\".\n3. Turn \"We don't think\" into \"It is suggested that no action...\".\n4. Replace \"Can you...\" with \"Would you be able to...\".\n5. Replace \"She looks like\" with \"She resembles\".\n\nBut how to generalize this into a single instruction?\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the instruction is to rephrase the inputs into more formal or polite language, possibly using different constructions. Let's see:\n\n- For the first example, replacing \"I think\" with a formal expression.\n- Second example, using \"understood\" instead of \"got\".\n- Third, changing opinion to a suggestion.\n- Fourth, making the question more polite.\n- Fifth, using a more formal synonym.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the instruction involves turning direct questions into requests or more polite forms. Like \"Can you...\" becomes \"Would you be able to...\", which is more polite.\n\nSimilarly, \"She looks like her sister\" becomes \"She resembles her sister\" because \"resembles\" is a more formal term.\n\nLooking at the first example, maybe the instruction was to rephrase \"I think\" into \"It is my opinion that...\" but only in certain cases where the speaker is stating their view. However, without knowing the exact instruction, we need to find a pattern that covers all examples.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might be to rephrase the inputs into their formal equivalents, where each input has a corresponding formal term or phrase. For example:\n\n- \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion that\"\n- \"I got\" → \"I understood\"\n- \"don't think\" → \"it is suggested\"\n- \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\"\n- \"looks like\" → \"resembles\"\n\nBut how to combine these into a coherent instruction. Perhaps the instruction is to convert the input into a more formal or polite version by replacing certain phrases with their formal counterparts.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could involve converting reported speech into a more formal structure. For example, the third input's output is a suggestion, which might be part of a report or formal communication.\n\nWait, looking at the third input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" The output is \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" This could be part of a formal report where suggestions are made instead of stating opinions. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase statements of personal opinion into formal recommendations or suggestions.\n\nSimilarly, the first example turns \"I think\" into \"It is my opinion that\", which might be appropriate in a formal context. The second example is formalizing \"got\" to \"understood\". The fourth example is making the question more polite. The fifth example replaces \"looks like\" with \"resembles\".\n\nAnother possibility: The instruction was to translate the inputs into their subjunctive equivalents, but none of the examples seem to fit that. For instance, \"Can you do...\" → \"Would you be able to...\" is not a subjunctive form; it's more about politeness.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction involved converting present tense verbs into past tenses? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: \"think\" → output \"opinion that this is interesting\" – no change in tense.\n\nSecond input: \"got\" → \"understood\" – present to past?\n\nThird input: \"think\" → \"suggested\" – present to past?\n\nFourth input: \"do\" → \"do\" – no change.\n\nFifth input: \"looks\" → \"resembles\" – no change.\n\nSo that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a passive voice. Let's see:\n\nFirst output: \"It is my opinion...\" – passive, yes. The original was active (\"I think\"). So passive conversion.\n\nThird output: \"It is suggested...\" – also passive. Original was active (\"We don't think\").\n\nFourth output: \"Would you be able...\" – not passive.\n\nHmm, so only the first and third outputs are passive, others are not. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to rephrase the subject. For example, first input's subject is \"I\", output is \"It\". But that's inconsistent elsewhere.\n\nWait, in the second input, \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\". Subject remains \"I\", but \"got\" becomes \"understood\".\n\nThird input: \"We don't think...\" → \"It is suggested...\". Subject changes from \"We\" to \"It\".\n\nFourth input: \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\". Subject changes from \"you\" to \"you\".\n\nFifth input: \"She looks...\" → \"She resembles...\". Subject remains \"She\".\n\nSo varying changes here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the subject to third person or use different pronouns. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction was to make the sentences more indirect. For example, first input is a direct statement (\"I think...\") converted to \"It is my opinion...\", which is a more indirect way of expressing the same thing. Third input's output is an indirect suggestion instead of a direct opinion.\n\nBut how to tie all this together. Let's consider that the instruction is to rephrase the inputs into a more formal or polite style, possibly using different grammatical structures, synonyms, or more indirect expressions.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Use \"it is my opinion that\" instead of \"I think that\".\n- Replace \"got\" with \"understood\".\n- Turn negatives into suggestions.\n- Make questions more polite with \"would be able to\".\n- Use \"resembles\" instead of \"looks like\".\n\nSo the instruction could be something like: \"Convert each input into a more formal or polite version by replacing certain phrases with their formal equivalents, adjusting sentence structure, and using appropriate vocabulary.\"\n\nBut how to phrase that as an instruction. Alternatively, the instruction might have been more specific, like:\n\n\"Replace 'I think' with 'It is my opinion that', 'I got' with 'I understood', 'We don't think' with 'It is suggested that', 'Can you...' with 'Would you be able to...', and 'She looks like' with 'She resembles'.\"\n\nBut that's very specific and probably not the case. Since the user only provided five examples, the actual instruction could be a general guideline rather than specific replacements.\n\nWait, another observation: All outputs start with the first letter capitalized. But the inputs do too, so that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the inputs using a thesaurus approach, replacing certain words with their synonyms while maintaining the sentence structure. For example:\n\n- \"think\" → \"opinion\" (using \"my opinion\")\n- \"got\" → \"understood\"\n- \"don't think\" → \"suggested\" (as in \"It is suggested that...\")\n- \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\"\n- \"looks like\" → \"resembles\"\n\nBut this requires knowing which words to replace with synonyms, which might depend on context. However, the examples show that \"I think\" becomes \"my opinion\", \"think\" isn't replaced directly. So perhaps the instruction was to convert the subject and verb to a more formal construction.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction was to rephrase the inputs into a more indirect or passive voice structure, but not all examples fit that.\n\nWait, let's look at the first output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" The structure here is \"It is [subject] [verb] that...\" where the original is \"I think [that...].\"\n\nSimilarly, the third output is \"It is suggested...\" So both outputs start with \"It is...\", which might indicate that the instruction involved starting the sentence with \"It is\" followed by a different subject (like \"my opinion\" or \"suggested\").\n\nBut that doesn't explain the second example: \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you\". So \"I got\" → \"I understood\", which doesn't fit the \"It is...\" structure.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the instruction was to transform the input into a third-person perspective. For example:\n\n- \"I think...\" → \"It is my opinion...\"\n- \"We don't think...\" → \"It is suggested...\"\n- \"She looks like...\" → \"She resembles...\"\n\nBut \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you\", which is still first person. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction was to rephrase the input by replacing certain verbs with their base forms or adding modifiers. For example, \"think\" → \"my opinion\", \"got\" → \"understood\", \"can\" → \"be able to\", \"looks like\" → \"resembles\".\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have involved changing the sentence type. For example, the first input is a statement, and the output is still a statement. The fourth input is a question turned into a statement (\"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\"), but the fifth input is a statement turned into another statement.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let's try to hypothesize what the instruction could be based on common language transformation techniques.\n\nPossible instruction types:\n\n1. Formalizing the language: Replace informal expressions with formal ones.\n2. Politeness strategy: Convert direct questions into more polite ones.\n3. Rephrasing opinions into suggestions.\n4. Using passive voice or indirect expressions.\n5. Converting reported speech into a different structure.\n\nLet's test each hypothesis against the examples.\n\n1. Formalizing: The second example fits (\"I got\" → \"I understood\"), fourth (\"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\"), fifth (\"looks like\" → \"resembles\"). First example uses \"opinion\", third uses \"suggested\". This seems plausible.\n\n2. Politeness: Fourth example is definitely more polite. Second example could be seen as slightly more formal, but not particularly polite. Third example is a suggestion, which might be more polite. First example uses \"my opinion\", which is a more personal but somewhat formal way of stating an opinion.\n\n3. Rephrasing opinions into suggestions: Third example fits perfectly (\"We don't think...\" → \"It is suggested...\"). First example might not fit unless the instruction was specifically to turn opinions into suggestions, but the first example just uses a different expression.\n\n4. Passive voice/indirect: First example (\"I think\" → \"It is my opinion\") uses passive. Third example (\"We don't think\" → \"It is suggested\") also passive. So that applies to two examples. Others don't.\n\n5. Reported speech: The third example's output is a suggestion, which could be reporting someone else's suggestion. But not sure.\n\nCombining these observations, the instruction might be a combination of formalizing, making polite requests, and rephrasing opinions into suggestions where applicable.\n\nBut how to formulate this as a single instruction. Maybe the instruction was: \"Rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version by replacing informal expressions with their formal equivalents, converting direct questions into more polite inquiries, and transforming statements of opinion into suggestions or indirect expressions.\"\n\nAlternatively, more concisely: \"Your task is to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version. This may involve replacing informal terms with their formal equivalents, converting questions into more polite forms, and rephrasing opinions as indirect suggestions.\"\n\nBut the key here is that the friend generated these outputs based on an instruction that the user provided. Since the user gave five examples, the instruction must cover all of them.\n\nLooking back at the examples:\n\n- First input becomes a more formal statement starting with \"It is my opinion\".\n- Second becomes a more formal \"understood\".\n- Third becomes a suggestion (\"it is suggested\").\n- Fourth becomes a polite \"Would you be able to...\".\n- Fifth becomes a more formal synonym.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version, applying different transformations depending on the original wording. The instruction might have specified that for each input, you need to adjust it accordingly based on certain patterns.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Replace \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion that\".\n- Replace \"I got\" with \"I understood\".\n- Replace \"We don't think\" with \"It is suggested that no action...\".\n- Replace \"Can you...\" with \"Would you be able to...\".\n- Replace \"She looks like\" with \"She resembles\".\n\nBut the instruction would need to provide these specific mappings. However, since the user didn't provide such a long list, it's possible that the instruction was more general, like \"Formalize the input by replacing certain phrases and adjusting the sentence structure appropriately.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have involved using a thesaurus or synonym tool to replace specific words or phrases. For example, \"think\" → \"opinion\", \"got\" → \"understood\", \"can\" → \"be able to\", \"looks",

The user provided five input-output pairs where each output seems to be a rephrased version of the input. So first, I need to analyze the patterns between each input and its corresponding output to deduce the general rule or transformation applied.\n\nStarting with the first example:\nInput: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" \nOutput: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n\nHmm, looking at this, the output seems more formal and uses \"is suggested\" instead of \"don't think it's a good idea.\" Also, the original input says \"do anything right now,\" but the output is phrased as \"no action should be taken.\" Maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentence in a more polite or formal tone, perhaps replacing negative suggestions with positive recommendations? Or maybe changing the perspective from first person to a suggestion format.\n\nSecond input:\nInput: \"Please call once you get there.\"\nOutput: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n\nHere, \"once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival.\" So the preposition \"once\" was replaced with \"upon,\" and the pronoun \"you\" might have been incorporated into the phrase. Also, \"call once\" becomes \"call upon your arrival,\" which is a bit more formal.\n\nThird input:\nInput: \"See you tonight.\"\nOutput: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n\nThis seems like converting an informal greeting into a more structured expression of anticipation. The original is a simple invitation, and the output is a polite expression of looking forward to seeing someone. The key here might be replacing direct addresses with a more formal statement of intent.\n\nFourth input:\nInput: \"I considered many approaches.\"\nOutput: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n\nHere, the original uses \"I\" and the past tense. The output removes \"I\" and uses the passive voice \"were considered.\" So maybe the instruction was to convert first-person statements into third-person passive voice or objective statements.\n\nFifth input:\nInput: \"Do you want me to go with you?\"\nOutput: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n\nThe question is rephrased using \"shall I\" instead of \"do you want me to.\" The verb structure changes from auxiliary (do + want) to a modal (shall). Also, \"go with you\" becomes \"accompany you,\" which is a more formal way of expressing the same idea.\n\nNow, trying to find a common thread. Let's list possible transformations:\n\n1. Formalizing the language (e.g., replacing contractions, using more polite verbs).\n2. Changing sentence structure (like passive vs. active voice).\n3. Updating pronouns or person references.\n4. Converting questions into requests with modals.\n5. Reframing the message in a more positive or constructive way.\n\nLooking across all examples, it seems that each input is being transformed into a more polite, formal, or structured version. For instance:\n\n- The first input's output replaces the negative \"don't think it's a good idea\" with a positive suggestion.\n- The second example adds formality with \"upon your arrival.\"\n- The third input turns a casual \"see you\" into a formal anticipation of meeting.\n- The fourth changes first-person to passive voice.\n- The fifth converts a \"do you...\" question into a conditional \"shall I...\"\n\nSo putting this together, the instruction might have been something like: \"Rewrite the following sentences in a more polite and formal tone, using appropriate language transformations.\" However, each example uses different transformations, so maybe the instruction was more specific about certain aspects.\n\nWait, but the user gave five different outputs, each requiring different transformations. So the instruction could be broader, like \"Rephrase each input into a more professional and courteous response,\" with the system applying various grammatical adjustments as needed based on the context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was about changing reported speech into indirect questions or statements. For example, the fifth input's output uses \"shall I,\" which is a subjunctive mood, often used in polite requests. But not sure if that applies to all examples.\n\nAnother angle: checking for common words or phrases used in outputs that aren't in inputs. Like \"I look forward to,\" \"It is suggested,\" \"various approaches were considered,\" \"shall I.\" These might indicate that the instruction involved replacing certain expressions with others, possibly through synonym substitution or restructuring.\n\nAlternatively, considering the outputs as more structured responses. For instance, the third input is a greeting turned into a promise to meet. The second example is a reminder phrased more formally. The first example becomes a recommendation.\n\nBut the key seems to be that each output is a more formal, polite, or structured version of the input, possibly adjusting grammar, vocabulary, or sentence structure. So the instruction was likely along the lines of \"Polish each input into a more professional and courteous response,\" or \"Convert each input into a formal suggestion or statement,\" with the system applying appropriate transformations based on context.\n\nWait, but the first example's output is actually more prescriptive (\"it is suggested\"), whereas the input is a statement of their own opinion. That might imply that the instruction is to rephrase subjective opinions into objective suggestions. For example, turning \"we don't think...\" into \"it is suggested that...\" which is more formal and implies a recommendation rather than a personal opinion.\n\nSimilarly, the third input's output is a forward-looking statement (\"I look forward to...\") which is more structured than \"see you.\" So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase in a way that expresses anticipation or formality, rather than casual greetings.\n\nAnother thought: looking at the verbs. For example, \"considered\" (input) vs. \"were considered\" (output), so changing the subject from \"I\" to \"Various approaches\" (passive voice). The fifth input's \"want me to go\" becomes \"shall I accompany you,\" which is a shift from a question to a statement using \"shall I.\"\n\nSo combining all these observations, the instruction might have been: \"Rephrase the given statement into a more formal and polite response, adjusting the verb tenses, sentence structures, and vocabulary accordingly. This could involve converting subjective opinions into objective recommendations, adjusting pronouns, restructuring questions into requests using modals like 'shall,' and formalizing the language with terms like 'I look forward to' or 'it is suggested.'\" \n\nBut wait, some examples don't fit that. For instance, the first input's output starts with \"It is suggested...\" which is more formal. The second example uses \"upon your arrival,\" which is formal. The third example transforms a casual \"see you\" into a formal expression of anticipation. The fourth example changes \"I considered\" to \"various approaches were considered,\" which is third person passive. The fifth example turns \"do you want...\" into \"shall I...\" So the common thread is formalizing, rephrasing into more formal structures, possibly using modals (shall), adjusting subject-verb agreement, and rephrasing in passive voice or third person.\n\nTherefore, the instruction was probably something like: \"Rework each input into a more formal and polite response. This may include changing the perspective from first person to third person, adjusting sentence structures, replacing contractions with full forms, and using more formal vocabulary such as 'suggested,' 'accompany,' or 'look forward to.'\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have specified certain transformations, like converting questions into offers using \"shall I\" or replacing certain phrases with more formal alternatives.\n\nGiven that each output requires a different kind of transformation but all follow a pattern of becoming more formal or structured, the most accurate instruction would be one that directs the assistant to rephrase the input in a more polite, formal, and grammatically adjusted manner, potentially using synonyms, restructuring sentences, and adhering to conventions of formal writing.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was: **\"Polish each input into a formal and courteous response, adjusting language, grammar, and structure to enhance clarity and politeness.\"**  \n\nThis involved systematically transforming the inputs into more formal versions by:  \n1. **Rephrasing subjective opinions into objective suggestions** (e.g., \"we don’t think...\" → \"it is suggested...\").  \n2. **Adding formality via polite constructions** (e.g., \"call upon your arrival\" for \"call once you get there\").  \n3. **Converting casual greetings into structured anticipation** (e.g., \"see you\" → \"I look forward to...\").  \n4. **Adjusting verb tenses and voices** (e.g., passive voice in \"various approaches were considered\").  \n5. **Replacing questions with modal requests** (e.g., \"do you want...\" → \"shall I...\").  \n\nEach output reflects careful restructuring to adhere to formal communication norms.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

Hmm, each input is transformed into a specific output. I need to look for patterns or common changes in each example.\n\nStarting with the first pair: Input \"Please call once you get there.\" became \"Please call upon your arrival.\" The main change here is replacing \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\". So maybe the instruction is to convert expressions like \"once you [verb]\" or \"when you [verb]\" into more formal or specific phrases like \"upon your arrival\", \"afterwards\", etc.\n\nSecond example: \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Here, \"whole\" was replaced with \"entire\", which are synonyms. But maybe the instruction is to replace some adjectives or nouns with their more formal equivalents. Or perhaps \"made up\" is a colloquial expression, and the instruction is to rephrase it using a more standard English phrasing.\n\nThird input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output changed \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". That seems like changing the pronoun from subject case to object case. Wait, but in the original sentence, \"I met\" is the subject, so maybe the instruction is to change the possessive pronoun after \"lawyer\" to use the object form \"whom\"? Because \"I met\" is the subject, so the relative pronoun should be \"whom\" as the object. So maybe the instruction was to replace \"I met\" with \"whom I met\"?\n\nFourth input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" Here, the output changed \"many approaches\" to \"various approaches\" and also rearranged the structure slightly. The original is active voice, and the output is passive voice. So maybe the instruction involves converting the sentence into passive voice? Let's check the next example.\n\nFifth input: \"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\" The output is a completely different verb. \"Got\" as in \"understand\" or \"receive\"? Here, it's rephrased using a synonym for \"understood\". So maybe the instruction is to replace verbs with their synonyms, often making the sentence more formal or specific.\n\nNow, trying to piece this together. Each transformation has multiple changes. Let's categorize possible instructions:\n\n1. Passive voice conversion (fourth example).\n2. Replacement of informal words/phrases with more formal or standardized ones (first, second, fifth).\n3. Changing pronoun cases (third example).\n4. Replacing parts of speech (adjectives, nouns) with synonyms.\n5. Restructuring sentence elements (like rearranging clauses).\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\nFor the first example, \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\" – maybe replacing temporal expressions with more formal terms.\n\nSecond: \"whole\" → \"entire\", \"made up\" → \"fabricated\" – synonyms, perhaps replacing colloquial terms.\n\nThird: changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" – adjusting pronoun usage to object case after a prepositional phrase.\n\nFourth: active to passive voice (\"considered\" → \"were considered\").\n\nFifth: \"got what you said\" → \"understood you\" – replacing the verb with a synonym, changing subject-verb structure (original is \"I got\" which is present perfect, output is \"I understood\" which is simple past).\n\nBut how do these fit under one instruction? Maybe the instruction is a combination of tasks. For instance, the friend was instructed to perform multiple transformations: convert to passive voice, replace colloquialisms with formal equivalents, adjust pronoun cases, and replace verbs with synonyms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was something like: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal or standard version, replacing informal language, converting to passive voice when possible, adjusting pronoun usage, and rephrasing where appropriate.\"\n\nBut let's check if all examples fit this. Let's take each input and see what changes align with this.\n\nFirst input: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Formalized time reference. So replacing \"once\" with \"upon\" and adjusting the pronoun from subject \"you\" to object \"your\".\n\nSecond input: \"was made up\" → \"was fabricated\". Colloquial vs formal. \"Whole\" → \"entire\". These seem like replacing informal expressions with standard ones.\n\nThird input: \"I met\" → \"whom I met\". Correcting the pronoun to object form after \"whom\".\n\nFourth input: \"considered many approaches\" → \"various approaches were considered\". Passive voice conversion.\n\nFifth input: \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\". Changed \"got\" to \"understood\" (synonym), adjusted structure to simple past from present perfect.\n\nSo if the instruction was to rewrite the inputs into a more formal style by making these specific changes: replacing temporal phrases with more formal ones, converting to passive where applicable, adjusting pronoun cases, replacing informal words with standard ones, and rephrasing verbs, then all the outputs align.\n\nAnother angle: looking for common transformations. For example, the third example is about changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". So whenever the sentence includes a possessive pronoun followed by \"met\", replace it with \"whom I met\".\n\nSimilarly, the fourth example converts active to passive voice. The first example replaces \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\". The fifth example changes \"got\" to \"understood\".\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was: \"Rewrite each input into a more professional tone by making the following changes:\n\n1. Replace 'I met' with 'whom I met' when referring to a meeting.\n2. Convert sentences from active to passive voice where applicable.\n3. Replace informal phrases like 'once you get there' with more formal alternatives.\n4. Replace informal verbs like 'got' with their standard counterparts.\n5. Replace informal expressions like 'made up' with standard phrasing.\n\nAdditionally, adjust pronoun usage to match the context, e.g., changing subject pronouns to object pronouns in certain positions.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was more specific. For example, the friend was told to perform certain edits based on a list of rules, such as:\n\n- When you see 'got', replace it with 'understood'.\n- When you see 'whole', replace with 'entire'.\n- When you see 'made up', replace with 'fabricated'.\n- When you see 'once you get there', replace with 'upon your arrival'.\n- When you see 'I met', replace with 'whom I met'.\n- Convert to passive voice if possible.\n- Etc.\n\nBut the problem is that some of the changes are part of a larger transformation. For example, converting \"I considered many approaches\" to \"various approaches were considered\" involves both changing \"many approaches\" to \"various approaches\" and converting to passive voice. So the instruction might require a combination of actions.\n\nGiven that all these transformations are different aspects of rewriting to make the language more formal or precise, the most plausible instruction would be something like: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal version by adjusting pronoun usage, replacing informal expressions with more standard alternatives, converting to passive voice where possible, and rephrasing verbs and noun phrases as needed.\"\n\nBut the key is that the friend followed multiple steps. To determine the exact instruction, we need to find a pattern that applies to all examples.\n\nLooking at the third example: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" This changes \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". So perhaps the instruction was to correct pronoun case after prepositions. For example, whenever \"I\" is used as a subject, change it to \"me\" or \"whom\" depending on its role.\n\nIn standard English grammar, after prepositions, the object form is required. So \"I met\" (active) becomes \"me was met\" or \"whom was met\". But in the output, it's \"whom I met\", which is the object form + subject. Wait, no. The original is \"I met [lawyer]\", so \"whom I met\" makes sense as the lawyer is the object of \"met\". So maybe the instruction was to replace \"I met\" with \"whom I met\" when \"I\" is the subject of the main clause and \"met\" is the main verb.\n\nBut that's a specific case. Perhaps the instruction was to use the appropriate pronoun case after certain prepositions. For example, replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met\".\n\nSo combining all these observations, the instruction could be: \"Adjust the pronoun cases in each input according to standard English grammar rules, replace informal expressions with more formal or standard alternatives, convert to passive voice where appropriate, rephrase verbs and noun phrases for clarity, and rewrite the sentence structure to improve formality.\"\n\nHowever, given that all the outputs are distinct from their inputs, the instruction likely involved a set of specific edits rather than general guidance. But without knowing exactly what the friend was supposed to do step-by-step, it's challenging.\n\nWait, another approach: the friend may have been given a list of tasks to perform, like:\n\n- Replace \"I met\" with \"whom I met\".\n- Convert active voice to passive voice.\n- Replace \"got\" with \"understood\".\n- Replace \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\".\n- Replace \"whole\" with \"entire\".\n- Replace \"made up\" with \"fabricated\".\n- Replace \"many approaches\" with \"various approaches\".\n\nBut this seems too specific, and the outputs vary. Alternatively, the instruction could be a set of rules for each specific case. However, since each input leads to a different output, it's more likely that the instruction was a general guideline, and the friend applied multiple transformations based on that.\n\nBut how to formulate the instruction? Let's think about common editing tasks. Often, when people give writing tips, they mention things like correcting pronoun cases, rephrasing, making passive where possible, etc. The examples here include:\n\n1. Temporal rephrasing (once → upon arrival)\n2. Colloquial to formal (whole → entire; made up → fabricated)\n3. Pronoun case correction (I met → whom I met)\n4. Passive voice conversion (considered → were considered)\n5. Synonym replacement (got → understood)\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction might be: \"Refine each input by making the following adjustments:\n\n1. Adjust pronoun cases according to grammatical rules.\n2. Replace informal expressions with their standard equivalents.\n3. Convert sentences to passive voice when possible.\n4. Rephrase verbs and noun phrases to enhance clarity and formality.\n5. Use more specific or formal vocabulary where appropriate.\"\n\nThis covers all the examples. For instance:\n\n- First input: Adjusted the pronoun case (once you get there → upon your arrival – maybe rephrasing as a temporal expression).\n- Second input: Replaced informal \"whole\" with \"entire\", \"made up\" with \"fabricated\".\n- Third input: Adjusted pronoun case from \"I met\" to \"whom I met\".\n- Fourth input: Converted to passive voice.\n- Fifth input: Replaced \"got\" with \"understood\", and changed sentence structure from present perfect to simple past.\n\nThus, the instruction likely involved a combination of these refinements. Since the question asks for the instruction the friend followed, the answer would be a summary of these steps.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction given to the friend involved refining each input through a multi-step process focused on enhancing clarity, formality, and grammatical correctness. Below is the structured breakdown of the instruction:\n\n### Instruction Breakdown:\n1. **Adjust Pronoun Cases**:  \n   - Replace \"I\" with its object form (\"me\" or \"whom\") when necessary, especially after prepositions or in dependent clauses.  \n   - Example: **\"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"** → **\"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"**\n\n2. **Convert to Passive Voice**:  \n   - Transform active voice sentences into passive voice where appropriate, emphasizing the action rather than the subject.  \n   - Example: **\"I considered many approaches.\"** → **\"Various approaches were considered.\"**\n\n3. **Replace Informal/Colloquial Expressions**:  \n   - Substitute informal phrases with standard equivalents to improve formality.  \n   - Example:  \n     - **\"Please call once you get there.\"** → **\"Please call upon your arrival.\"**  \n     - **\"The whole story was made up.\"** → **\"The entire story was fabricated.\"**\n\n4. **Rephrase Verbs and Noun Phrases**:  \n   - Replace vague or colloquial verbs/nouns with more precise synonyms or alternatives.  \n   - Examples:  \n     - **\"I got what you said.\"** → **\"I understood you.\"**  \n     - **\"I considered many approaches.\"** → **\"Various approaches were considered.\"**\n\n5. **Temporal and Structural Refinement**:  \n   - Adjust time-related expressions and sentence structures for clarity.  \n   - Example: **\"Please call once you get there.\"** → **\"Please call upon your arrival.\"**\n\n---\n\n### Final Output Derivation:\nApplying these refinements systematically to each input results in the final outputs provided. The friend’s task was to implement these targeted transformations to ensure clarity, precision, and formality in each response.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs where each input was transformed into an output according to some rule or instruction. My job is to reverse-engineer what that instruction was based on the examples given.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nInputs:\n1. Can you do all these tasks?\n   Output: Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\n\n2. We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\n   Output: It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\n\n3. See you tonight.\n   Output: I look forward to meeting you tonight.\n\n4. I can't stand his temper.\n   Output: I cannot tolerate his temper.\n\n5. She looks like her sister.\n   Output: She resembles her sister.\n\nHmm, let's analyze each pair one by one to see if there's a common transformation.\n\nStarting with the first input-output pair:\n- Input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" (a question)\n- Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" (another question, slightly rephrased)\n\nSo here, the structure changed from a present tense question (\"Can you...\") to a future tense possibility (\"Would you be able to...\"). The subject is still \"you,\" but the phrasing is adjusted.\n\nSecond pair:\n- Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" (statement expressing opinion)\n- Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" (rephrasing as a suggestion, changing the perspective from a negative opinion to a positive suggestion, and altering the structure.)\n\nThird pair:\n- Input: \"See you tonight.\" (informal greeting)\n- Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" (polite anticipation, converting the casual plan into an expression of looking forward to it.)\n\nFourth pair:\n- Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" (expression of intense dislike)\n- Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" (using \"tolerate\" instead of \"can't stand,\" more formal maybe?)\n\nFifth pair:\n- Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" (observation of similarity)\n- Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" (using \"resemble\" instead of \"look like,\" which might be seen as a more formal synonym.)\n\nLooking for common threads:\n\n1. Transformation from one verb form to another, often using synonyms that fit different contexts or tones.\n2. Changing sentence structures: questions to conditional questions, statements to suggestions, informal expressions to more formal ones, etc.\n3. Substituting certain verbs or phrases with more formal alternatives.\n\nLet's break down possible instruction components:\n\n- For the first pair, \"do\" becomes \"accomplish,\" which are similar but more formal. Similarly, \"stand\" in \"can't stand\" becomes \"tolerate,\" which is more neutral or slightly formal.\n- In the second pair, the opinion \"don't think it's a good idea\" is turned into a suggestion phrased as \"it is suggested that...\" This changes the speaker's role from disagreeing to advising.\n- Third pair changes from \"see you\" to \"look forward to meeting you,\" which is a more formal and anticipatory way of greeting.\n- Fourth pair uses \"tolerate\" instead of \"stand,\" both mean can't bear, but different connotations.\n- Fifth pair uses \"resemble\" instead of \"look like,\" which is a more formal way of saying they are similar.\n\nPossible instructions could involve transforming each input into a more formal version, using different synonyms, restructuring sentences, or converting statements into questions/suggestions, etc.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, many seem to replace contractions (like \"don't\" -> \"is suggested that no action should be taken\") or informal terms with more formal language. For example, \"I can't stand\" becomes \"I cannot tolerate.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a different grammatical form, such as turning statements into questions, or using different verb tenses or modals.\n\nWait, looking at the third pair: \"See you\" vs \"I look forward to meeting you.\" That's not just a substitution; it's a completely different structure, replacing the imperative with a first-person expression of anticipation.\n\nSimilarly, the fourth pair is substituting \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate,\" keeping the same meaning but in a different form.\n\nThe fifth pair uses \"resemble\" as a synonym for \"look like,\" again swapping out words with more formal alternatives.\n\nFor the second pair, changing from \"don't think\" to \"is suggested that...\" seems like a shift from expressing an opinion to providing a suggestion. So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a different point of view, such as turning personal opinions into objective suggestions.\n\nAnother thought: the first output starts with \"Would you be able to...\" which could imply seeking permission or capability, while the input is a question asking ability. But the structure changes from \"can\" to \"would be able to,\" which might be considered more polite or tentative.\n\nPutting this all together, the instruction might be to rephrase each input into a more formal or indirect version, using synonyms, different grammatical structures, or adjusting the tone. For example, converting questions into conditional or hypothetical questions, informal expressions into more polite alternatives, or expressing suggestions rather than opinions.\n\nBut how to formulate a single instruction that covers all these transformations? Let's consider possible instruction options:\n\n1. \"Rewrite each input by replacing contractions with expanded forms and using more formal language.\"\n   - For example, \"We don't think...\" becomes \"It is suggested that...\" which aligns with the second pair.\n\n2. \"Convert each input into a more polite or indirect expression, using synonyms and alternative phrasing.\"\n   - This would explain why \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate,\" \"look like\" becomes \"resemble,\" etc.\n\n3. \"Rephrase each input into a different grammatical structure, such as changing questions to conditionals or statements to suggestions.\"\n   - This would cover the first pair (question to conditional), third pair (imperative to first-person expression), and second pair (opinion to suggestion).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to generate a question that inquires about the possibility implied by the original statement, hence the first pair's transformation.\n\nWait, the first input is a question asking ability. The output is phrased as a conditional question suggesting the ability to do something. So perhaps the instruction was to turn the original statement into a question that implies the possibility of accomplishing the task.\n\nSimilarly, the second input expresses an opinion against doing something now, and the output is a suggestion that action shouldn't be taken, which is a way to indirectly advise against it.\n\nThe third input is a casual plan (\"See you\"), output is a more polite and forward-looking statement.\n\nFourth input is an expression of intense dislike, output substitutes \"tolerate\" which is less strong.\n\nFifth input is an observation of similarity, output uses \"resemble\" instead of \"look like,\" possibly more formal.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction might be: \"For each input, rephrase it into a more polite or indirect version, using synonyms or alternative phrasing to convey the same meaning but in a different tone.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be: \"Generate a question that implies the possibility or capability expressed in the original input.\"\n\nWait, but not all outputs are questions. For example, the output for the second input is a suggestion, not a question.\n\nAnother approach: The outputs vary widely, so the instruction must be broad enough to cover multiple transformation types. However, the key commonality might be that each output is a more formal restatement, possibly using different vocabulary or sentence structures.\n\nLooking at the first pair: Original is a question, output is a conditional question (implying possibility). The second input's output is a suggestion rather than a statement of opinion. Third is changing from imperative to anticipation. Fourth substitutes \"tolerate\" for \"can't stand.\" Fifth swaps \"look like\" for \"resemble.\"\n\nPerhaps the general instruction is: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal and indirect version by substituting specific phrases, adjusting verb tenses, or changing sentence structure.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the original into a question that expresses the same idea but in a different way, even if not exactly a direct transformation.\n\nBut then the third input's output is not a question. So that might not fit.\n\nWait, the third input is \"See you tonight,\" which is an informal greeting. The output is \"I look forward to meeting you tonight,\" which is a more formal and anticipatory response. So the instruction could be to transform greetings or plans into expressions of looking forward to them, using \"I look forward to...\" instead of the original phrase.\n\nSimilarly, the fourth input's output uses \"tolerate\" instead of \"can't stand,\" which is a common synonym replacement in more formal contexts.\n\nThe fifth pair uses \"resemble\" instead of \"look like,\" which is a synonym substitution, probably for more formal language.\n\nThe second pair's input expresses a negative opinion, and the output is a suggestion, so maybe the instruction was to rephrase opinions into recommendations or suggestions.\n\nBut how to encapsulate all these into a single instruction? The most plausible common thread is that each output is a more formal or indirect version of the input, possibly using synonyms, alternative phrasing, or restructuring the sentence to change the tone.\n\nAnother angle: Let's check if the outputs are all generated using a specific part-of-speech substitution. For example, substituting verbs, adjectives, or nouns with synonyms. For instance:\n\n- \"stand\" → \"tolerate\"\n- \"think it's a good idea\" → \"suggest no action\"\n- \"look like\" → \"resemble\"\n- \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\"\n\nIn some cases, the entire phrase is replaced (like \"don't think it's a good idea\" becomes \"is suggested that...\"). So perhaps the instruction involved replacing certain phrases or using different lexicon based on context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to generate a question that asks about the possibility implied by the input. For example, the first input is a question asking ability, and the output is a conditional question implying the same ability but framed differently.\n\nSimilarly, the second input's output is a suggestion, which could be seen as a way to ask for advice indirectly. But that seems less direct.\n\nAnother possibility: The instruction was to convert each input into a rhetorical question that makes the same point, but phrased differently. For example, the second input's output is not a question but a suggestion, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a question that expresses the same meaning but in a different grammatical structure. However, the third output isn't a question, so that can't be it.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to write the output as a question that inquires about the possibility mentioned in the input. For example:\n\nInput: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" (which does inquire about the ability, but uses \"would\" instead of \"can.\")\n\nSimilarly, if the input was \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now,\" the output suggests an alternative action, which is a way to ask for advice.\n\nBut this line of thinking might not fit all examples. The fourth input's output is not a question but a restatement. The third input's output is also not a question.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the outputs again:\n\n- 1. Question → Conditional question\n- 2. Statement → Suggestion\n- 3. Greeting → Anticipation\n- 4. Expression of dislike → More neutral phrase\n- 5. Observation of similarity → Formal synonym\n\nThe common element here is that the outputs are more formal, indirect, or polite than the inputs. For example, \"I can't stand\" is softened to \"cannot tolerate,\" which might be more appropriate in certain contexts. \"See you\" becomes a more polite expression of looking forward. \"Don't think it's a good idea\" is rephrased into a suggestion.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal, polite, or indirect expression by using synonyms, adjusting verb tenses, or changing the sentence structure.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been: \"For each input, rephrase it into a question that addresses the possibility or implication of the original statement.\"\n\nBut that doesn't fit all examples. The third output isn't a question.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the verbs used in outputs versus inputs:\n\n1. \"Can\" → \"Would be able to\" (more modal flexibility)\n2. \"Think\" → \"Suggest\"\n3. \"See\" → \"Look forward to\"\n4. \"Can't stand\" → \"Cannot tolerate\" (same negative connotation, different verbs)\n5. \"Looks like\" → \"Resembles\" (synonym swap)\n\nThis suggests substitution of certain verbs and phrases with others that carry similar meanings but different connotations or contexts.\n\nAdditionally, some outputs use different sentence structures. For instance, the third input is an imperative, and the output is a first-person expression. This could imply transforming the input into a different person perspective.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was: \"Transform each input by replacing key verbs and phrases with more formal or indirect alternatives, adjusting the sentence structure as needed to maintain the original meaning.\"\n\nTo confirm, let's test this hypothesis against the examples:\n\n1. Original: \"Can you...\" (querying ability) → Output: \"Would you be able...\" (conditional query, allowing for hesitation or different circumstances). This maintains the query format but adds modality (would) and ability (able).\n\n2. Original: \"We don't think...\" (expressing doubt/opinion) → Output: \"It is suggested...\" (turning opinion into advice). This shifts the perspective from expressing uncertainty to making a recommendation.\n\n3. Original: \"See you...\" (informal plan) → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you...\" (formal anticipation). Changes from second-person to first-person, adds \"look forward to\" for politeness.\n\n4. Original: \"I can't stand...\" (intense dislike) → Output: \"I cannot tolerate...\" (substitute \"tolerate\" for \"can't stand,\" more neutral and less extreme).\n\n5. Original: \"She looks like...\" (casual observation) → Output: \"She resembles...\" (use more formal synonym).\n\nEach of these changes seems to involve replacing certain words or phrases with their synonyms or formal equivalents, adjusting the sentence structure to fit the new vocabulary. Additionally, some examples involve changing the sentence's subject or perspective (e.g., from \"we don't think\" to \"it is suggested\").\n\nTherefore, the likely instruction was: \"Replace key verbs and phrases with more formal or indirect alternatives, adjusting the sentence structure as needed to reflect a polite or professional tone, while maintaining the core meaning.\"\n\nAlternatively, it could have been: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal version by substituting specific words and phrases, modifying verb tenses, and restructuring the sentence to express the same idea in a different manner.\"\n\nEither way, the goal seems to be producing outputs that are more formal, polite, or indirect compared to the inputs, using synonym substitutions and structural adjustments.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to the friend was to **transform each input into a more formal, polite, or indirect version** by replacing specific words or phrases, adjusting sentence structures, and using synonyms to enhance formality or clarity. Here’s the breakdown:\n\n### Key Transformations Observed:\n1. **Verbal Tense/Modality**: \n   - Changed \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able...\" (input-output pair 1).\n   - Replaced \"We don’t think...\" with \"It is suggested...\" (input-output pair 2).\n\n2. **Substitution of Phrases**:\n   - Exchanged \"can’t stand\" for \"cannot tolerate\" (input-output pair 4).\n   - Replaced \"looks like\" with \"resembles\" (input-output pair 5).\n\n3. **Structural Adjustments**:\n   - Shifted \"See you...\" to \"I look forward to meeting you...\" (input-output pair 3).\n   - Rephrased opinions into recommendations (e.g., \"shouldn’t take action\").\n\n4. **Formality Level**:\n   - Softened informal expressions (\"can’t stand,\" \"don’t think\") with more neutral/diplomatic terms.\n   - Converted casual plans into anticipation-focused statements.\n\n### General Instruction:\n**\"Rewrite each input into a more formal or indirect expression by substituting specific words, adjusting grammar, and/or changing sentence structure to maintain the original meaning but enhance politeness or formality.\"**\n\nThis approach ensures the outputs align with professional or polite communication norms while preserving the essence of the original messages.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs where each output seems to be a rephrased version of the input, but perhaps with more polite or formal language. Let me start by analyzing each pair to see if there's a common pattern.\n\nFirst pair:\nInput: \"I think that this is interesting.\"\nOutput: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\nSo here, the output uses \"it is my opinion\" instead of \"I think\". That's a more formal way of expressing agreement or stating a view. Maybe the instruction was to make the statement sound more polite or professional?\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: \"Do you want me to go with you?\"\nOutput: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\nOriginal is a question using \"want me to...\", and the output uses \"shall I accompany...\" which is more formal and uses \"accompany\" instead of the less formal \"go with you\". So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the question into a more polite request, perhaps using \"shall I\" or similar phrases.\n\nThird pair:\nInput: \"I got what you said.\"\nOutput: \"I understood you.\"\nOriginal is informal, using \"got\" and \"said\". The output uses \"understood you\" which is more direct and perhaps a bit more formal. So maybe the task was to convert the input into a more standard or polite expression.\n\nFourth pair:\nInput: \"This song is fire.\"\nOutput: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\nHere, \"fire\" is colloquial, and the output replaces it with a more refined term. So possibly replacing slang or informal expressions with more formal synonyms.\n\nFifth pair:\nInput: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\"\nOutput: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\nOriginal uses \"can't tell the difference\", which is informal, whereas the output uses \"find it hard to distinguish\" which is more polite and uses a longer phrase.\n\nLooking at all these examples, the instruction likely involved rephrasing each input into a more formal or polite version. The outputs use more elevated vocabulary, more complete sentences, and perhaps more indirect speech (like asking \"shall I\" instead of \"do you want me to\").\n\nWait, but let me check again. For example, the first input is \"I think... \" and the output starts with \"It is my opinion...\". So the instruction might have been to convert first-person statements into third-person and add a modifier like \"my opinion\" or \"your idea\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to turn statements into questions, but in the second input, the output is a statement. Hmm. Wait, no, the second input is a question, output is a statement. So that's not it. The instruction isn't about changing question into statements.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the structure. The outputs often have longer, more complex sentences than the inputs. For example, \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" vs. \"I think that...\" The output adds a clause and a modifier (\"my opinion\"). Similarly, \"Shall I accompany you?\" vs. \"Do you want me to go with you?\" The output removes the \"me\" (as in \"you want me\") and replaces \"go with\" with \"accompany\", making it more formal.\n\nSo possible instruction could be: \"Convert each input into a more formal, polite version, using more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures.\"\n\nBut wait, the fifth input/output is another case where the input is a statement and output is also a statement. So maybe the task is to rephrase any kind of statement into a more formal tone.\n\nLet me look for other possible patterns. The outputs in some cases replace contractions (e.g., \"can't tell\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\"), which might indicate a need to avoid contractions. Or maybe the instruction was to use non-contracted forms.\n\nAnother example: \"I got what you said.\" becomes \"I understood you.\" Here, \"got\" is a colloquial verb, replaced with a more formal \"understood\". Also, \"you said\" becomes \"you\" directly. So perhaps replacing casual verbs and simplifying the sentence.\n\nSimilarly, \"fire\" is slang, replaced with \"incredibly good\". So the instruction might have been to replace informal expressions with more refined alternatives.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction likely was: \"Rewrite each given statement in a more formal, polite, and precise manner, avoiding contractions and using more elevated vocabulary. Adjust the sentence structure to enhance clarity and formality.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's more specific. For example, the instruction could have been to rephrase into indirect questions (like turning \"Do you want...\" into \"Shall I...\"). But in the first pair, the input is a statement, output is also a statement. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to convert first-person expressions into third-person, adding a modifier like \"my opinion\", \"your understanding\", etc. Let's check:\n\nFirst input: \"I think...\" → output starts with \"It is my opinion...\". So yes, that matches. Second input: \"Do you want...\" → output is \"Shall I...\" which is a third-person construction. Third input: \"I got...\" → output is \"I understood you.\" Fourth input: \"This song is fire.\" → \"is incredibly good\". Fifth input: \"I can't tell the difference...\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n\nSo in the first case, the instruction might be to rephrase \"I think...\" into \"It is my opinion that...\". Second, converting \"Do you want...\" into \"Shall I...\". Third, replacing \"I got...\" with \"I understood you.\" Fourth, replacing slang \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\". Fifth, converting \"I can't tell...\" into \"I find it hard to distinguish...\".\n\nBut how do these fit into a single instruction? Let's see:\n\nPerhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version, possibly using more elaborate language, avoiding contractions, and sometimes restructuring the sentence (e.g., using \"shall I\" instead of \"do you want me to...\"). Alternatively, the instruction could have been to replace certain expressions with more formal equivalents.\n\nAnother possibility is that the instruction was to translate the input into a different style, such as converting from informal to formal register, adjusting politeness levels, or using different tenses or sentence structures.\n\nFor instance, the outputs in all cases seem to have higher register. For example, replacing \"think\" with \"opinion\", \"want\" with \"accompany\", \"got\" with \"understood\", \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\", and \"can't tell\" with \"find it hard\".\n\nSo the instruction might be something like: \"Rewrite each input statement in a more formal and polite manner, using more sophisticated vocabulary and complete sentences without contractions. Convert direct questions into more indirect or polite requests when appropriate.\"\n\nBut to test this, let's check the examples against this hypothesis.\n\nTake the first input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" The output is \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" This follows the hypothesis by replacing \"I think\" with \"it is my opinion\" and using a more formal construction. The second input's output uses \"Shall I accompany you?\" which is a polite request, matching the hypothesis of converting \"want me to...\" into a more polite form. The third input's output replaces \"got\" with \"understood\", removes \"what you said\", and uses \"you\" directly. The fourth input's output replaces slang with a synonym. The fifth input's output replaces \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n\nYes, this seems consistent. Therefore, the instruction likely was to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, and sophisticated version, possibly by replacing contractions, adjusting vocabulary, and structuring sentences more formally.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction given was likely to **rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, and refined version**, adhering to higher linguistic standards. This involves several key adjustments:\n\n1. **Register Upgrade**: Replace informal terms (e.g., \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\", \"can't tell\" → \"find it hard\") with more elevated vocabulary.\n2. **Politeness Adjustment**: Convert direct requests into indirect or polite phrasing (e.g., \"Shall I accompany you?\" for \"Do you want me to go with you?\").\n3. **Contractions Removal**: Avoid contractions like \"I got\" → \"I understood you\".\n4. **Sentence Structure**: Enhance formality by restructuring (e.g., \"It is my opinion that...\" vs. \"I think...\").\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nThe instruction was to **rewrite each input in a more formal and polite manner**, using sophisticated vocabulary, complete sentences, and higher linguistic register. Specifically, this involved converting statements into formal opinions, restructuring questions into polite requests, removing contractions, and replacing informal expressions with refined synonyms.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

So, the friend received an instruction along with five different input-output pairs and then generated outputs based on that instruction. My job is to deduce what the original instruction might have been.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each input-output pair to see if there's a common pattern or transformation applied. Let's start one by one.\n\n1. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n   Hmm. The output seems more formal and perhaps rephrases the input. The original is a thanking someone for their help, and the output is a more formal way of saying the same thing. Maybe the instruction was to rewrite the sentence in a more polite or formal tone?\n\n2. Next input-output pair: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n   The input is a question asking if the person wants them to come along, and the output is a suggestion phrased as a question using \"Shall I...\". So here, the output is turning the request into a proposal, perhaps in a more formal or polite way. It uses \"accompany\" instead of \"go with\", which might be part of the pattern.\n\n3. Third example: \"I considered many approaches.\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n   The output here is changing \"many\" to \"various\" and rephrasing the sentence structure. Instead of \"I considered\", it's \"Various approaches were considered\". So maybe the instruction was to paraphrase the input while maintaining the meaning but using synonyms or restructuring the sentence?\n\n4. Fourth input-output: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n   Again, a synonym substitution. \"can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish\". The structure is similar but with different phrasing. So this could fit a pattern of replacing certain phrases with synonyms.\n\n5. Fifth input-output: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n   Here, \"can't stand\" is replaced with \"cannot tolerate\". So again, substituting a collocation with another phrase.\n\nPutting all these together, looking for a common thread. The first pair changes the gratitude into a more formal expression. The second turns a request into a polite offer. The third changes \"many approaches\" to \"various\" and shifts subject-verb structure. Fourth and fifth examples replace specific idiomatic expressions (\"can't tell the difference\" vs. \"find it hard to distinguish\") and (\"can't stand\" vs. \"cannot tolerate\"). \n\nWait, but the first example might be more about rephrasing the entire sentence structure. For instance, the original is \"You did something for me\" (implied), and the output is phrased as \"Your assistance is appreciated.\" But in the input-output pair, the original is \"Thanks for your help,\" which is a direct expression of thanks, and the output is a more formal way of expressing the same sentiment. Similarly, the second example takes the question \"Do you want...\" and turns it into a suggestion \"Shall I...\". \n\nAnother angle: looking for transformations across all examples. The first input is transformed from a direct statement into a more indirect, formal way. The second is a yes/no question turned into a suggestion. The third is a simple past tense statement rephrased. The fourth and fifth are synonyms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert informal language into more formal or academic phrasing. Let's check the outputs:\n\nOriginal 1: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Formal response: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n\nOriginal 2: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Formal response: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n\nOriginal 3: \"I considered many approaches.\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" The output uses \"were considered\" instead of \"considered\", which is a passive voice shift. Also, \"many\" becomes \"various\".\n\nOriginal 4: \"I can't tell the difference...\" → \"I find it hard...\" So replacing \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n\nOriginal 5: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\".\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to convert the input into a more formal register, possibly involving replacing informal phrases with more sophisticated vocabulary, restructuring sentences, and ensuring politeness or formality. \n\nBut wait, the second example doesn't involve replacing words but rather rephrasing the question into a suggestion. Similarly, the first example is rephrasing \"Thanks\" into a more formal acknowledgment. The third example uses passive voice and synonyms. The fourth and fifth use synonyms.\n\nSo combining all these transformations, the instruction might be to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite version. Alternatively, the instruction could be to convert the input into a passive voice construction when possible, using more elevated vocabulary like synonyms (many → various, can't tell → find it hard to distinguish), and adjusting sentence structure for formality (e.g., \"You considered\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered\").\n\nAnother possibility: the instruction was to translate the input into a different style, perhaps academic writing versus conversational. For example, using more formal vocabulary, restructuring sentences, or employing more complex grammatical structures.\n\nLooking for keywords in the instructions. Since the outputs often use \"Your assistance\", \"accompany\", \"various\", \"tolerate\", \"distinguish\"—these are more formal terms. The first example transforms \"Thanks for your help\" into \"Your assistance is much appreciated\", which is a bit more formal than just saying thanks. So perhaps the instruction was to turn the input into a more formal, perhaps even academic, statement. \n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to rephrase each input using more precise vocabulary. For example, \"considered many approaches\" becomes \"various approaches were considered\", where \"considered\" is retained but \"many\" is changed to \"various\" and the sentence structure adjusted. Similarly, \"can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish\", which is a more formal phrasing.\n\nIn the second input-output pair, the instruction might have been to rephrase the question into a suggestion using \"Shall I...\", which is a more formal way of offering assistance. So transforming a request into a polite offer.\n\nSo putting all these together, the most likely instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, and possibly more academically inclined version. This would involve several elements:\n\n1. Converting requests into offers or suggestions, possibly using \"Shall I...\", \"May I...\", etc.\n2. Using more elevated vocabulary: \"assistance\" instead of \"help\", \"accompany\" instead of \"go with\", \"tolerate\" instead of \"stand\".\n3. Restructuring sentences for formality, such as passive voice or subject-verb inversion.\n4. Replacing idiomatic expressions with their more formal equivalents (\"find it hard to distinguish\" instead of \"can't tell the difference\").\n5. Ensuring politeness in the responses.\n\nAnother angle: looking for patterns in the outputs that aren't immediately obvious. For example, the first input is a direct thank you, output is a more indirect, formal expression. The second is a question turned into a polite offer. The third is a statement rephrased. The fourth and fifth are synonyms. \n\nIf we consider that the instruction is to rephrase each input in a certain way, perhaps the instruction was something like: \"For each input, rewrite it in a more formal and polite manner, using appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.\" That would encompass all the examples given. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a different style, such as converting colloquial into formal, or adapting to a particular register. \n\nAnother thought: looking at the verb tenses and forms. For example, \"considered many approaches\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered.\" The passive voice here might be part of making it more formal. Also, the use of \"were considered\" instead of \"considered\" adds a bit more formality. \n\nSimilarly, \"I can't tell the difference\" becomes \"I find it hard to distinguish,\" which is a more formal phrasing. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the instruction was likely to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, and academically inclined version. This would involve replacing informal expressions with more elevated language, restructuring sentences for formality, and adjusting the tone to be more professional or respectful.\n\nTherefore, the instruction probably stated something along the lines of: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal and polite version, using appropriate vocabulary, sentence structure, and maintaining the original meaning.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to rephrase each input into a **more formal and polite version**, using appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure. Specifically, the goal was to:\n1. **Replace informal phrases** with more elevated language (e.g., \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\").\n2. **Adjust sentence structure** for formality (e.g., \"I considered many approaches\" → \"Various approaches were considered\").\n3. **Transform questions into polite offers** (e.g., \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\").\n4. **Use formal terms** (e.g., \"assistance,\" \"tolerate\").\n5. **Ensure politeness** through careful rewording.\n\nThis approach aligns with all input-output pairs provided, reflecting a systematic conversion to a more formal, academically inclined tone.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

So, looking at each pair, I need to see if there's a pattern or transformation that connects the input to the output.\n\nFirst, the first input is \"I considered many approaches.\" The output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" Hmm, so here, the output seems to be a rephrasing of the same sentence but using more varied vocabulary. \"Considered\" stays the same, but \"many approaches\" becomes \"various approaches.\" Maybe \"various\" is a synonym for \"many,\" but also adds a bit more nuance, like different types rather than just quantity. But wait, in the input, it's \"many approaches,\" which is about quantity, while the output uses \"various,\" which might imply diversity. Interesting.\n\nSecond input: \"Thanks for your help.\" Output is \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Here, the friend is converting the direct \"thanks\" into a more formal expression of gratitude. \"Your help\" becomes \"assistance,\" which is a noun instead of the verb form, and \"much appreciated\" adds emphasis with \"much.\" So maybe the instruction is to rephrase expressions of thanks into more formal or eloquent phrasing?\n\nThird input: \"She looks like her sister.\" Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" Again, synonyms being used. \"Looks like\" is a colloquial way, whereas \"resembles\" is a more formal term for similarity. So perhaps the task is to replace informal expressions with more precise or academic vocabulary.\n\nFourth input: \"See you tonight.\" Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This is a significant change. The input is a casual farewell, and the output is a more formal anticipation of the meeting. The structure here shifts from second person (\"See you\") to first person (\"I look forward\"), and the greeting becomes a positive expectation. So maybe the instruction involves transforming informal greetings into more formal or anticipatory statements.\n\nFifth input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" Here, the output simplifies the sentence slightly. The input is a somewhat casual \"got what you said,\" and the output replaces \"got\" (which can mean received or understood) with a more direct \"understood,\" and removes \"you said.\" So this could be about replacing contractions or informal phrasing with more straightforward language.\n\nNow, putting all these together, the common theme seems to be rephrasing the input sentences in a way that either enhances formality, replaces idiomatic expressions with more precise vocabulary, or transforms the tone from casual to polite or anticipatory. Let's break down possible instruction types.\n\nPossible options for instruction:\n\n1. **Rewrite the sentence using more formal language.** But some outputs don't seem more formal than the inputs. For example, the third input/output both use similar words. Wait, no—the third input uses \"looks like,\" output is \"resembles,\" which is more formal. Similarly, first input/output both have \"approaches,\" but the second part of the instruction might not always make the language more formal. Alternatively, maybe it's about replacing specific phrases with their synonyms.\n\n2. **Replace informal expressions with more formal equivalents.** For instance, changing \"thanks\" to \"assistance is much appreciated,\" \"see you\" to \"look forward,\" etc.\n\n3. **Redistribute sentence structure.** Like moving from second person to first person, as in the fourth example.\n\n4. **Convert reported speech or indirect speech?** Not sure. The fifth example doesn't fit that.\n\nAlternatively, considering the outputs are often more elaborate or use more positive framing. For example, \"See you\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you,\" which adds a positive expectation. So maybe the instruction is to transform each input into a more formal, appreciative response, especially for expressions of gratitude and farewells.\n\nAnother angle: looking for verbs that are changed. For example, \"considered\" becomes \"were considered\" (passive voice?), but that doesn't hold across all inputs. Or \"looks like\" to \"resembles\" (passive voice again?).\n\nWait, let's check passive vs active. First input: \"Many approaches were considered\" vs \"I considered many approaches.\" The output uses passive voice here, which might be a pattern. But not all outputs use passive. Second output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" – that's passive. Third: \"She resembles her sister\" (passive). Fourth: \"I look forward to meeting you\" (active). Fifth: \"I understood you\" (active).\n\nHmm, inconsistent. So maybe not a consistent voice change.\n\nLooking back, the fifth output is \"I understood you\" vs input \"I got what you said.\" Here, \"got what you said\" is a contraction and phrased as the speaker receiving the message. The output replaces \"got\" with \"understood\" and removes \"what you said,\" making it more direct. So perhaps the instruction is to eliminate contractions, replace with more direct verbs, and adjust phrasing to be clearer or more precise.\n\nSimilarly, the second input/output: \"Thanks for your help\" to \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Here, \"help\" becomes \"assistance,\" which is a noun form, adding \"much appreciated\" for emphasis.\n\nThe fourth example: changing \"See you\" to \"I look forward to meeting you.\" This could be part of the instruction to turn greetings into formal expressions of anticipation.\n\nPutting this all together, the most plausible instruction might be: \"Rewrite each input sentence to use more formal or polite language, replacing contractions, adjusting verb forms, and enhancing phrasing where necessary.\"\n\nBut let's check if that fits all examples:\n\n1. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\" Here, replacing \"considered\" with itself, but changing \"many\" to \"various,\" which is more formal. Also, passive voice introduced in the output, but the input is active. So maybe not passive voice, but more precise adjectives.\n\nYes, \"various\" is more precise than \"many\" in this context. So perhaps the instruction is to replace informal adjectives with more precise ones, or use more formal terms when possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to use synonyms where applicable and make the language more formal.\n\nAnother thought: The fourth input/output is a good clue. \"See you\" transformed into \"I look forward to meeting you.\" This is a common phrase used to respond to a casual greeting with a more formal statement expressing anticipation. So perhaps the instruction is to convert informal greetings into formal, anticipatory responses.\n\nSimilarly, the second input/output uses \"assistance\" (noun) instead of \"help\" (verb), which is a bit more formal. The third input/output replaces \"looks like\" with \"resembles,\" which is more formal.\n\nThe fifth input/output replaces the casual \"I got what you said\" with \"I understood you,\" removing the contraction and replacing with a more direct statement.\n\nSo maybe the instruction is: \"For each input, rephrase it into a more formal and polite version, especially when responding to expressions of thanks, farewells, or similar phrases.\"\n\nAlternatively, another possible instruction could be \"Paraphrase each sentence using synonyms where appropriate, particularly replacing informal or colloquial terms with more precise or elevated vocabulary.\"\n\nTesting this hypothesis against the inputs:\n\n1. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\" Here, \"considered\" remains, but \"many approaches\" becomes \"various,\" which is a synonym but slightly more formal and perhaps implies variety rather than quantity. Also, the addition of \"were\" makes it passive. But the original is active. So perhaps the instruction is to use passive voice for certain actions. But in other examples, like the third output, \"She resembles her sister\" is passive, but the input was active. So inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the entire sentence using synonyms, making the overall meaning the same but with more varied vocabulary. For example, \"She looks like her sister\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" Both are correct, but \"resembles\" is more formal.\n\nIn the first case, \"I considered many approaches\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" Here, \"various\" is a synonym for \"many,\" and the passive voice might indicate that the action is attributed to the approaches rather than the subject. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input sentence by replacing certain key words with their synonyms and adjusting the sentence structure accordingly. For example, \"many\" → \"various,\" \"help\" → \"assistance,\" \"see you\" → \"look forward to meeting you,\" etc.\n\nAnother angle: The outputs often start with the same subject as the input. For example, first input starts with \"I,\" output starts with \"Various approaches.\" Wait, no—the first output is \"Various approaches were considered,\" which uses passive voice. So the subject changes. The third input is \"She looks like her sister\" → output \"She resembles her sister.\" Same subject. Fourth input: \"See you tonight\" → \"I look forward...\" Different subject. Fifth input: \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you.\" Same subject.\n\nSo in some cases, the subject remains the same, in others, it changes. The second input/output starts with \"Your assistance,\" so different subject.\n\nThis variation complicates things. Maybe the instruction involves transforming the input sentence regardless of structure, using synonyms and restructuring as needed.\n\nAnother possible instruction: \"Take each input sentence and rewrite it using synonyms to make the meaning equivalent but with more complex or formal wording.\"\n\nTesting that: The first input uses \"considered\" → \"were considered\" (passive), but that's not a synonym. Wait, the original is active voice, output is passive. Maybe the instruction was to write the past tense in passive voice. But then why the third input/output is passive? Third input is active (\"She looks like her sister\"), output is passive (\"She resembles her sister\"). So that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input using different parts of speech. For example, \"many approaches\" → \"various,\" changing from adjective to adjective.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to take the input and produce a paraphrase that conveys the same meaning but with varied wording, possibly using synonyms or rephrasing techniques.\n\nLooking at all the outputs, it seems like each input is transformed into a version that uses more formal or precise language, sometimes changing sentence structure, sometimes adjusting word choice, and sometimes expanding the phrasing.\n\nAnother key point is that some outputs are more elaborate. For example, \"See you\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This adds more information (tonight) and changes the perspective from third person (you) to first person (me). So the instruction might involve turning casual addresses into formal invitations or statements of expectation.\n\nThe fifth output also drops the \"you said\" part, making it more direct.\n\nPutting all these observations together, the most comprehensive instruction that fits all examples is likely: \"Rewrite each input sentence into a more formal or polite version by replacing contractions, using synonyms where appropriate, and adjusting the phrasing to enhance politeness or formality where necessary.\"\n\nAlternatively, another possible instruction could be \"For each input, convert the sentence into its passive voice equivalent using appropriate adjectives or nouns.\"\n\nBut testing that against the examples:\n\nFirst input: \"I considered many approaches\" → passive would be \"Many approaches were considered\" – matches the output. Second input: \"Thanks for your help\" → passive would be \"Your help was given/acknowledged,\" but the output is \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nThird input: \"She looks like her sister\" → passive is \"Her sister is looked like\" which isn't correct. So passive voice might not be the right approach here.\n\nAnother angle: The instruction could be to replace specific idiomatic expressions with their more formal equivalents. For example, \"See you\" → \"Anticipate seeing you,\" but the output uses \"look forward to meeting you.\" The structure here is different.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might be: \"Given an input sentence, rephrase it using a more formal register by replacing informal or conversational elements with more elevated or precise vocabulary, while maintaining the original meaning.\"\n\nConsidering all these possibilities, the best fit seems to be an instruction that instructs the friend to rephrase the input sentences into more formal versions, using synonyms and adjusting phrasing to enhance politeness or formality, particularly for common expressions like thanks, farewells, and direct statements.\n\nTo confirm, let's check each input-output pair with this instruction:\n\n1. \"I considered many approaches\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" Using synonyms (various instead of many) and passive voice for formality.\n\n2. \"Thanks for your help\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Formal synonyms (assistance) and added emphasis (much appreciated).\n\n3. \"She looks like her sister\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" Formal synonym (resembles) for \"looks like.\"\n\n4. \"See you tonight\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This is more formal and expresses anticipation, changing from second to first person.\n\n5. \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you.\" Removes contraction, replaces \"got\" with \"understood,\" and eliminates \"what you said\" for clarity.\n\nThis instruction covers all cases. Each output is a more formal version of the input, using synonyms, adjusting vocabulary, and/or restructuring sentences for politeness or clarity.\n\nTherefore, the most probable instruction the friend received was: \"Rewrite each input sentence into a more formal or polite version by replacing contractions, using synonyms where appropriate, and adjusting phrasing to enhance formality or clarity.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to the friend was:  \n**\"Rewrite each input sentence into a more formal or polite version by replacing contractions, using synonyms where appropriate, and adjusting phrasing to enhance formality or clarity.\"**  \n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Formal Language Enhancement**:  \n   - Replacing informal phrases (e.g., \"help\" → \"assistance\", \"got\" → \"understood\") with more refined terminology.  \n   - Using synonyms like \"various\" (instead of \"many\"), \"resembles\" (instead of \"looks like\"), and restructuring \"see you\" into a formal anticipation (\"look forward to meeting you\").  \n\n2. **Politeness & Formality Adjustments**:  \n   - Transforming casual expressions (\"thanks\", \"see you\") into more formal or appreciative statements (\"much appreciated\", \"look forward to\").  \n   - Addressing others directly (\"your help\", \"you said\") with respectful synonyms (\"assistance\", \"understood\").  \n\n3. **Phrasing Simplification/Clarification**:  \n   - Removing contractions (e.g., \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\") for clarity.  \n\nThese transformations align with the outputs provided, reflecting the friend’s task of rephrasing inputs into more formal, polite, and structured responses.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction based on these examples.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to see if I can spot a pattern or common transformation rule.\n\nInput 1: \"Please call once you get there.\" Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\nWait, so \"once you get there\" is changed to \"upon your arrival\". That seems like a more formal or polite version. Maybe converting \"once you arrive\" into \"upon your arrival\" when they are the same in meaning? Not sure yet.\n\nInput 2: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, the input had \"I met\", and the output added a relative pronoun \"whom\" instead of \"me\". So maybe replacing \"me\", \"I\", \"my\" with \"whom\" in certain contexts? But not all. Let's check others.\n\nInput 3: \"This song is fire.\" Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\" So \"fire\" is being replaced with \"incredibly good\". \"Fire\" as slang for awesome, but here it's converted into a more descriptive phrase. So maybe replacing informal expressions with more formal or specific alternatives.\n\nInput 4: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\" Here, the entire question is transformed into a more formal or traditional phrasing. The first person \"me\" becomes \"I\", \"you\" stays as \"you\", and the structure changes from a general question (\"want me to\") to a more formal offer (\"Shall I accompany\"). So maybe converting modern/colloquial questions into more traditional or polite forms.\n\nInput 5: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" So \"got\" (slang) is replaced with \"understood\", and \"what you said\" is simplified to \"you\". The structure changes from present tense to past tense as well, but maybe that's part of the transformation. So perhaps converting casual language into more formal or standard phrasing, replacing slang terms and adjusting sentence structure.\n\nNow, looking at all these, perhaps the instruction was to rewrite each input into a more formal or traditional style, replacing informal expressions with their more standard equivalents. Let me check each example against this hypothesis.\n\nInput 1: Original is a bit informal, using \"call once you get there\". The output uses \"upon your arrival\" which is more formal. So yes, replacing the casual phrasing with a more traditional turn of phrase.\n\nInput 2: Changed \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". Wait, no—original was \"I met\", output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the \"I met\" became \"whom I met\". So replacing \"me\" with \"whom\" after a preposition? But in the output, it's \"whom I met\", which is correct grammar for a relative clause. So maybe whenever there's a direct object like \"me\", it's replaced with \"whom\" when possible? But in some cases, like \"I met him\" vs \"He met me\", but here it's \"whom I met\". Interesting.\n\nInput 3: \"fire\" is slang for great. The output replaces that with \"incredibly good\". So replacing slang with more descriptive words. That fits the idea of making the language more formal or precise.\n\nInput 4: The question is changed from a modern \"Do you want me...\" to a more old-fashioned \"Shall I...\" The structure is transformed into a conditional offer rather than a simple yes/no question. Also, \"me\" becomes \"I\" and \"go with you\" becomes \"accompany you\". So maybe changing subject-verb structures to more formal ones.\n\nInput 5: \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you\". So \"got\" (from \"get\") is a colloquial way to express understanding, replaced with \"understood\". Also, \"what you said\" is shortened to \"you\". So maybe removing unnecessary words and phrases, replacing them with more standard or concise terms.\n\nPutting this together, the instruction likely involves rephrasing the input text to conform to a more formal or traditional style. This would include replacing informal contractions, colloquialisms, and conversational phrasing with their more standard equivalents. For example:\n\n- Changing \"call once you get there\" to \"call upon your arrival\" to be more formal.\n- Replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met\" in a relative clause, possibly in a context where using \"whom\" is appropriate (even though the original used \"I met\").\n- Replacing slang like \"fire\" with descriptive adjectives.\n- Transforming questions like \"Do you want me to...\" into offers starting with \"Shall I...\" which is a more formal construction.\n- Replacing \"I got what you said\" with \"I understood you\" to eliminate slang and shorten the phrase.\n\nSo the instruction might have been something along the lines of \"Rewrite each input into a more formal style by replacing informal or conversational elements with their more standard equivalents.\" Alternatively, it could be phrased as \"Convert the given sentences into a traditional or polite form, adjusting phrasing, replacing slang, and modifying structures as needed.\"\n\nWait, but let's check if there's another angle. For example, in Input 2, \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\"—that might indicate that whenever there's a prepositional phrase like \"I met...\", it's replaced with the object case. But why only in that case? Maybe the instruction was specifically to change indirect objects or prepositional objects. However, in the input, it's \"I met\" (no preposition), but in the output, it's \"whom I met\". Hmm, perhaps that's a rule related to relative clauses. For example, in the input sentence, \"The lawyer [who/whom] I met yesterday was helpful,\" the original uses \"I met\", which is the subject. But in the output, \"whom\" is used, suggesting that whenever there's a relative clause with \"I/me\", use \"whom\"? Wait, but the original input didn't have a relative clause. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the original input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the instruction might have been to replace \"I/me\" with \"whom\" when it follows a verb like \"met\". Wait, but in the input, it's \"I met\", which is the subject. The output adds \"whom\" to make it a relative clause. Maybe the instruction was to convert the phrase \"I met\" into \"whom I met\" when it's part of a larger clause. But that doesn't seem consistent. Alternatively, maybe whenever the subject is \"I\" followed by a verb, replace it with \"whom\" when forming a relative clause. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal style by making it passive voice? Let's check:\n\nInput 1: Passive would be \"You will be called upon by me when you arrive.\" No, that doesn't match the output. So probably not passive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using different conjunctions. For example, replacing \"once\" with \"upon\". In Input 1, \"once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival\". So replacing \"once\" with \"upon\".\n\nBut then in Input 3, \"is fire\" becomes \"is incredibly good\". So replacing the adjective \"fire\" with a longer, more descriptive phrase. That suggests a style change rather than a specific linguistic rule.\n\nIn Input 4, the structure changes from a simple question to a conditional offer. \"Do you want me to...\" becomes \"Shall I...\". So the instruction might involve transforming questions into offers using \"Shall I...\", changing the subject-verb structure from \"Do you...\" to \"Shall I...\" with the verb in the base form (go with you becomes accompany you).\n\nIn Input 5, \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you\". So replacing the slang \"got\" (from \"gotten\") with \"understood\", and shortening \"what you said\" to \"you\". So removing \"what\" and simplifying the phrase.\n\nSo putting all these transformations together, the instruction likely tells the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal or traditional style, possibly following certain patterns like:\n\n- Replace colloquial phrases with more formal or descriptive alternatives.\n- Convert questions into offers or suggestions using phrasing like \"Shall I...\" or \"Would you mind...\"\n- Adjust pronouns (e.g., \"me\" to \"I\") and sentence structures for politeness.\n- Remove unnecessary filler words or shorten phrases (like \"what you said\" to \"you\").\n\nAnother angle: looking at Input 2's transformation, \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". If the original had a relative clause, perhaps the instruction was to insert \"whom\" when referring to oneself in a relative clause. For example, if the input had a clause like \"the man who I met\", but the original was \"I met\", adding \"whom\" makes it a relative clause. But in the input, there's no relative clause. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace \"I/me\" with \"whom\" in any context where it's grammatically correct. But in the input, \"I met\" is a simple statement, not part of a relative clause. The output adds \"whom\", so perhaps the instruction was to modify the phrase \"I met\" into \"whom I met\" regardless of context, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe in the context of a relative clause, but since there isn't one in the input, perhaps that's a red herring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to make the text more formal by using more complex sentence structures. For example, replacing \"Please call once you get there\" with \"Please call upon your arrival,\" which is a more elevated phrasing.\n\nConsidering all these examples, the most plausible instruction is to rewrite each input into a more formal or polite version of the original. This would involve replacing informal language, colloquialisms, and conversational phrasing with their more standard equivalents, adjusting pronouns and verb forms for politeness, and restructuring sentences where necessary.\n\nTherefore, the instruction likely was something like:\n\n\"Rewrite each input into a more formal or traditional style by replacing informal or conversational elements with their more standard equivalents. This may involve adjusting pronouns (e.g., 'me' to 'I'), altering verb forms (e.g., 'want me' to 'accompany you'), replacing slang with descriptive terms, and restructuring sentences for clarity and formality.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided was likely to **rephrase each input into a more formal or traditional style** by replacing informal, colloquial, or conversational elements with their standardized equivalents. This involved several key transformations:\n\n1. **Politeness and Formality**:  \n   - Rewriting casual greetings (e.g., \"call once you get there\") into polite, elevated phrasing (e.g., \"call upon your arrival\").  \n   - Converting simple questions (e.g., \"Do you want me...\") into formal offers using antiquated constructs like \"Shall I...\" to maintain politeness.\n\n2. **Pronoun and Structure Adjustments**:  \n   - Replacing \"me\" with \"whom\" in relative clauses (e.g., changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\"), enhancing grammatical formality.  \n   - Shortening phrases and eliminating slang (e.g., \"got what you said\" → \"understood you\"), streamlining communication.\n\n3. **Slang and Descriptive Language**:  \n   - Replacing idiomatic slang (e.g., \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\") with precise adjectives to improve clarity.\n\n**Final Instruction**:  \n\"Rewrite each input into a more formal or traditional style by replacing informal or conversational elements with their standardized equivalents. This includes adjusting pronouns, verb tenses, phrasing, and removing slang or colloquialisms.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs.\nHere are the input-output pairs:\n\nInput: I think that this is interesting.\nOutput: It is my opinion that this is interesting.\n\nInput: Can you do all these tasks?\nOutput: Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\n\nInput: Please call once you get there.\nOutput: Please call upon your arrival.\n\nInput: I considered many approaches.\nOutput: Various approaches were considered.\n\nInput: Thanks for your help.\nOutput: Your assistance is much appreciated.\n\nThe instruction was<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<|begin_of_thought|>Okay, let's try to figure out what the original instruction was based on these input-output pairs. Hmm. So, the friend took each input and generated an output as shown. I need to find out what the general rule or transformation the instruction entails.\n\nFirst, looking at the outputs, they seem to be rephrasing the inputs but with some specific changes. Let me list out the possible patterns or transformations step by step.\n\nStarting with the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"I think that this is interesting.\"\nOutput: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\nHere, the instruction changed \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion.\" So maybe the rule is replacing certain phrases or converting from first-person to more formal or indirect expressions.\n\nSecond example:\nInput: \"Can you do all these tasks?\"\nOutput: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\nOriginal uses \"can,\" which is a present ability. The output uses \"be able to accomplish,\" which is similar in meaning but phrased differently. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase questions into more formal or indirect structures, perhaps changing modal verbs or using different constructions.\n\nThird input:\n\"Please call once you get there.\"\nOutput: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\nThe original is a casual \"once you get there.\" The output uses \"upon your arrival,\" which is more formal. So perhaps replacing certain conjunctions or expressions with more formal alternatives.\n\nFourth input:\n\"I considered many approaches.\"\nOutput: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\nThis seems like restructuring the sentence. The original is active voice: subject (I) did action (considered). The output is passive voice: various approaches were considered. So maybe the instruction involves converting active to passive voice or altering sentence structure.\n\nFifth input:\n\"Thanks for your help.\"\nOutput: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\nOriginal is a direct thank you. The output is more formal, using \"assistance\" and \"much appreciated.\" So perhaps replacing informal expressions with more formal ones.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction might involve transforming the input sentences into more formal or indirect language. Let's check if each output aligns with that.\n\nFor the first example, changing \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\" fits a shift towards formality. The second example's question structure using \"Would you...\" is more polite and formal than \"Can you...\". Third example replacing \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\" adds formality. Fourth example converting to passive voice. Fifth example replacing \"Thanks\" with \"Your assistance is appreciated.\"\n\nSo the instruction likely instructs the friend to rephrase the input sentences into more formal, indirect language, possibly making them sound more polite or professional. But let's see if there's a common rule or pattern here.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they seem to use more varied sentence structures. For instance, the third input becomes a past tense passive voice sentence. The fourth input is also passive. The first input is a change from active to more formal expression. The fifth input uses a more formal \"assistance\" instead of \"help.\" \n\nBut maybe there's a specific rule the instruction follows. For example, converting \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion,\" which could be part of a pattern where personal pronouns or direct statements are transformed into more objective or formal terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about adjusting the level of politeness. For example, changing \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\" increases politeness. Similarly, \"Thanks\" to \"Your assistance is appreciated\" is more formal.\n\nWait, but some examples don't fit that. The fourth input's output is passive voice. That might not necessarily be about politeness. So perhaps the instruction is a combination of making the language more formal, using different sentence structures (passive, etc.), and sometimes rephrasing questions into less direct forms.\n\nLet me think about possible instructions that could generate all these outputs. If the instruction was \"Rewrite each sentence into a more formal or indirect style,\" that would explain the outputs. However, the specific transformations vary. Let's see:\n\n- First input: Replace \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion.\"\n- Second input: Change \"can\" to \"be able to\" and the question to a less direct form.\n- Third input: Replace \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival.\"\n- Fourth input: Convert to passive voice.\n- Fifth input: Replace \"Thanks for your help\" with a more formal expression.\n\nSo each output requires a different kind of transformation. Therefore, the instruction must cover multiple aspects: formality, politeness, sentence structure, and vocabulary.\n\nBut how to phrase such an instruction concisely? Maybe something like \"Rephrase each sentence into a more formal style, using indirect language where appropriate, adjusting sentence structure, and choosing more formal alternatives where applicable.\"\n\nBut perhaps the instruction was more specific. For example, \"Convert each sentence to the third person passive voice and make it more polite,\" but that doesn't fit all examples. Alternatively, \"Rewrite each statement into a more formal tone, replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents, adjusting verb tenses if necessary, and using less direct language.\"\n\nWait, looking back at the outputs:\n\n1. \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion\" – change perspective from first to third person, and replace \"think\" with \"opinion.\"\n2. \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\" – change from simple can (ability) to a more polite form, using \"able to\" as alternative.\n3. \"Once you get there\" → \"Upon your arrival\" – replace casual expression with formal alternative.\n4. \"I considered\" → \"Various approaches were considered\" – active to passive, and quantifier \"many\" becomes \"various.\"\n5. \"Thanks\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" – replace gratitude with formal expression.\n\nSo each output has different elements. For example, the first output includes changing the perspective (first to third person) and replacing \"think\" with \"my opinion.\" The fourth example changes active to passive and quantifies. The fifth example replaces \"Thanks\" with a more formal expression.\n\nTherefore, the instruction likely involves multiple transformations: adjusting the perspective (first to third person), replacing certain verbs or phrases (like \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion\"), using more formal alternatives (thanks → assistance appreciated), changing sentence structure (questions, clauses), and altering parts of speech (many approaches → various approaches).\n\nSo putting all this together, the instruction might have been something like: \"Rework each sentence into a more formal and indirect style. Convert 'I think' to 'it is my opinion,' use more polite phrasing for questions, replace informal expressions with formal equivalents, adjust sentence structure where necessary, and consider transforming active to passive voice when appropriate.\"\n\nBut perhaps the instruction was more concise. Alternatively, maybe the key was to rewrite each input using more formal language, specifically converting \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion,\" changing can to would/able, etc. But without seeing the exact instruction, we have to infer.\n\nAnother approach: look for a common thread across all outputs. Let's see:\n\n1. Input: Statement. Output: More formal statement.\n2. Input: Question. Output: Polite, more formal question.\n3. Input: Instruction. Output: Formalized instruction.\n4. Input: Past experience. Output: Passive voice, more formal.\n5. Input: Gratitude. Output: Formal expression of thanks.\n\nSo each input type (statement, question, command, etc.) is transformed into a more formal version. So the instruction might be: \"Convert each sentence into a more formal tone, using indirect language where appropriate, adjusting verb tenses and structures as needed.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be: \"Rearrange each sentence to express the same meaning using more formal or polite phrasing.\"\n\nBut given the variety of transformations, the instruction probably covered multiple aspects of formality and politeness, possibly mentioning specific replacements like changing \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion,\" handling questions with more politeness, etc.\n\nWait, but the user didn't provide the actual instruction, just asked us to deduce it based on the input-output pairs. So we need to reverse-engineer the instruction from the examples.\n\nGiven that each output is a transformation of the input, the instruction likely required applying multiple rules. For example, for questions, change \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\" for politeness; for commands, rephrase as \"Please call upon your arrival\"; for statements, convert to passive or more formal expressions.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been a set of guidelines, such as \"For each input, rephrase it using more formal language, adjusting grammar and vocabulary as needed.\" But to match the examples, there must be specific guidelines applied.\n\nLet me check each output again:\n\n1. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" So the instruction here might have specified to convert first-person subjective statements to third-person objective opinions.\n\n2. Input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" This uses \"would\" for politeness and \"able to\" as a different way to express capability.\n\n3. Input: \"Please call once you get there.\" Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\" Here, replacing \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\" to use a more formal prepositional phrase.\n\n4. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\" This combines converting to passive voice (\"were considered\") and replacing \"many\" with \"various\" for a more formal nuance.\n\n5. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Replacing \"help\" with \"assistance\" and phrasing gratitude as an appreciation of assistance.\n\nSo, putting all these together, the instruction likely had multiple components:\n\n- For questions, use a more polite form, e.g., replace \"can\" with \"would\" + \"able to\" or \"be able to.\"\n- For commands, use \"please\" and replace casual phrases with more formal ones (e.g., \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\").\n- For statements expressing opinions, convert to third person and use \"my opinion.\"\n- For past experiences, consider passive voice and use formal quantifiers (many → various).\n- For gratitude, replace informal \"thanks\" with more formal expressions involving \"assistance\" and \"appreciated.\"\n\nAdditionally, the instruction might have covered adjusting sentence structures (passive voice, different conjunctions), using less direct language (e.g., \"you get there\" vs. \"your arrival\"), and replacing informal terms with more formal ones.\n\nTo summarize, the instruction was to rephrase each input sentence into a more formal or indirect style, possibly including the following adjustments:\n\n- **For statements:**\n  - Convert \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion.\"\n  - Use \"various\" instead of \"many\" for more formality.\n  - Consider passive voice for certain verbs.\n\n- **For questions:**\n  - Change \"can\" to \"would be able to\" for politeness.\n  - Replace direct questions with more formal phrasing.\n\n- **For commands:**\n  - Use \"please\" and replace casual expressions with formal equivalents (e.g., \"once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival\").\n\n- **For gratitude:**\n  - Replace \"Thanks for your help\" with \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n\nThe overall goal was to increase the formality and indirectness of the language, making the statements more polite, professional, or appropriate for certain contexts (like formal writing, business communication, etc.). Thus, the instruction would likely have emphasized applying these transformations systematically across different sentence types.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided was to rephrase each input sentence into a more formal and indirect style. The goal was to adjust the language for politeness, professionalism, or appropriateness in formal contexts. Below are the key transformations observed in the input-output pairs:\n\n### Key Rules Applied:\n1. **Questions**  \n   - Replace direct questions with more polite phrasing:  \n     - \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\"  \n     - Example: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n\n2. **Commands/Instructions**  \n   - Use \"please\" and replace casual expressions with formal alternatives:  \n     - \"Call once you get there\" → \"Call upon your arrival.\"  \n     - Example: \"Please call once you get there.\" → \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n\n3. **Statements**  \n   - Convert first-person perspectives to third-person:  \n     - \"I think...\" → \"It is my opinion...\"  \n     - Example: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"  \n\n   - Restructure using passive voice and formal quantifiers:  \n     - \"I considered many approaches.\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n\n4. **Gratitude**  \n   - Replace informal \"thank you\" with formal expressions of appreciation:  \n     - \"Thanks for your help.\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n\n### Final Instruction:  \n**\"Redesign each input into a more formal tone by adjusting grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure to ensure politeness, clarity, and suitability for formal contexts. Specifically, convert first-person statements to third-person opinions, rephrase questions with politeness, transform commands into formal requests, and replace casual gratitude with refined expressions of thanks.\"**\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The friend transformed each input into a different output by following some rule. My job is to reverse-engineer that rule.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to see patterns:\n\n1. Input: The whole story was made up.\n   Output: The entire story was fabricated.\n\n2. Input: Can you do all these tasks?\n   Output: Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\n\n3. Input: I think that this is interesting.\n   Output: It is my opinion that this is interesting.\n\n4. Input: I can't tell the difference between these two.\n   Output: I find it hard to distinguish between them.\n\n5. Input: See you tonight.\n   Output: I look forward to meeting you tonight.\n\nHmm. Let's look at each pair to see what changes or transformations happened.\n\nStarting with the first input/output pair:\nOriginal: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n\nLooking at the differences:\n- \"whole\" becomes \"entire\"\n- \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated\"\n\nWait, \"whole\" and \"entire\" are synonyms. But \"made up\" vs \"fabricated\"—are those synonyms? Let me check. Made up can mean composed of parts (as in the whole story) but also invented. Fabricated also means invented. So maybe the transformation here is replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\". But wait, \"whole story\" vs \"entire story\"—but why change \"whole\" to \"entire\"? Maybe \"whole\" here is being rephrased to \"entire\", and \"made up\" to \"fabricated\".\n\nBut then in the next example, input \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → output \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n\nOriginal question vs output:\nOriginal uses \"can you do...?\", output rephrases it as \"would you be able to accomplish...\". So the structure changes from a simple yes/no question to a more polite question phrased as ability. Also, the verb changes from \"do\" to \"accomplish\".\n\nThird example: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" So the original statement is changed by replacing \"I think that\" with \"It is my opinion that\". That seems like a form of hedging or making the statement less direct. Instead of taking responsibility (\"I think\"), it's presented as an opinion (\"my opinion\").\n\nFourth input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" The original uses \"can't tell the difference\", which is colloquial. The output uses more formal language, replacing \"can't\" with \"find it hard to\" and \"distinguish\" instead of \"tell the difference\".\n\nFifth input: \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This is a complete sentence vs the original casual greeting. The output transforms the greeting into an expression of looking forward, which might be considered more polite or professional.\n\nNow, considering all these examples, trying to find a common thread. Let's categorize possible transformations:\n\n1. Formality level: Some outputs seem more formal or polite. For example, turning \"See you\" into \"look forward to meeting you\" is a more formal response. Similarly, changing \"can't tell\" to \"hard to distinguish\" uses more formal phrasing.\n\n2. Rewriting phrases:\n- \"whole story\" → \"entire story\"\n- \"made up\" → \"fabricated\"\n- \"can you do...\" → \"Would you be able to accomplish...\"\n- \"I think that\" → \"It is my opinion that\"\n- \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\"\n\nAnother approach: Look for synonyms or different expressions that maintain the same meaning but use different words.\n\nLet's break down each input-output pair:\n\n1. Input: \"whole story\" → \"entire story\". \"Whole\" and \"entire\" are synonyms, so replacing them. \"Made up\" (meaning fabricated) → \"fabricated\".\n2. Input: Question structure. Changing \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\". So changing the tense/modal? Original is present tense, output uses future tense? Wait, \"Can you do\" is present tense, but \"Would you be able to\" uses would, which is modal indicating possibility. \"Accomplish\" is in base form. So maybe it's changing the question to a more polite phrasing using \"able to\" and rephrasing the structure.\n3. Input: \"I think that...\" → \"It is my opinion that...\". This is a way to make the statement more indirect or give credit to oneself, rather than directly stating their belief.\n4. Input: \"I can't tell the difference...\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish...\". Using \"find it hard to\" instead of \"can't tell\" makes it more about difficulty rather than inability.\n5. Input: Casual greeting \"See you...\" → Formal expression \"look forward to meeting you...\".\n\nLooking for a pattern across all transformations. Let's consider the original instruction could be to rephrase the inputs into more formal or professional language. However, the fifth example seems like a different type of rephrasing. Let's see:\n\nIn example 1, \"whole story\" to \"entire story\" is more formal. \"Fabricated\" is also more formal than \"made up\". Example 2's rephrasing uses more formal language. Example 3 uses \"opinion\" to soften the statement. Example 4 uses more formal phrasing (\"find it hard to distinguish\"). Example 5 is changing a greeting into an expression of anticipation, which is a bit more formal or polite.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to replace certain words with their synonym counterparts where possible. For instance, replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\", \"made up\" with \"fabricated\", \"can't tell\" with \"find it hard to distinguish\", etc.\n\nBut why does the second example change the entire structure from a question to a different structure? Let's see: Original is \"Can you...\", output is \"Would you be able to...\". So the structure is altered beyond just changing words. Maybe the instruction requires converting the input into a more polite or softer version, sometimes altering sentence structure.\n\nAnother angle: All outputs seem to have some kind of restructuring. For instance:\n\n1. Rephrasing \"the whole story was made up\" to \"the entire story was fabricated\": same structure but replaced words.\n2. \"Can you...\" becomes \"Would you be able to...\": different structure, adding \"be able to\".\n3. \"I think that...\" → \"It is my opinion that...\": changing subject and using \"opinion\".\n4. \"I can't tell the difference...\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish...\": different structure, more formal.\n5. \"See you...\" → \"I look forward to meeting you...\": completely different structure, turning a greeting into a statement of anticipation.\n\nHmm, perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly altering sentence structures when necessary. For example, in the second case, changing a question to a more indirect request. Let's test this hypothesis against all examples.\n\nExample 1 fits if the instruction was to make it more formal: \"whole\" to \"entire\", \"made up\" to \"fabricated\". Both are formal terms.\n\nExample 2: Original is a simple question. The output rephrases it as \"Would you be able to accomplish...\", which is more polite and uses a different structure. The modal \"would\" adds politeness. The phrase \"be able to\" makes it more about capability rather than direct questioning.\n\nExample 3: Changing \"I think that...\" to \"It is my opinion that...\" is a way to present the thought indirectly, which is more common in formal writing. This softens the statement by not taking personal responsibility.\n\nExample 4: \"can't tell the difference\" is colloquial. The output uses \"find it hard to distinguish\", which is more formal and uses a gerund phrase instead of an adjective phrase.\n\nExample 5: The output turns a casual greeting into a more formal expression of looking forward, which is a step up in formality.\n\nSo the instruction might be to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly altering sentence structures when needed. However, in example 3, the structure remains the same except for replacing \"I think that\" with \"It is my opinion that\". But in example 5, the entire structure changes from a greeting to a statement.\n\nAnother possible angle: All outputs are transformations that involve making the statements more objective or removing personal opinions. For example:\n\n- Example 3 replaces \"I think\" with \"it is my opinion\", which removes the speaker's subjectivity.\n- Example 1 changes \"made up\" (which can mean either literal fabrication or the whole story) to \"fabricated\", which might be more literal.\n- Example 2 rephrases a question into a different phrasing without changing content.\n- Example 4 replaces \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish\", which is about effort rather than ability.\n- Example 5 changes a greeting into an expression of anticipation, perhaps implying eagerness.\n\nWait, maybe the instruction was to convert statements into objective or neutral expressions where possible. For instance, replacing \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion\" removes the subjective aspect. Similarly, \"I look forward to meeting you\" is a neutral expression compared to \"See you\".\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, they seem to be transforming the inputs into more passive or formal language. Let's see:\n\n- Input 1 becomes passive voice (\"was made up\" → \"was fabricated\").\nWait, no. Original input is active voice, output is active voice. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in example 1: \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" The structure remains similar. The changes are noun synonyms.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to replace certain nouns with their synonym counterparts. For example:\n\n- \"whole\" → \"entire\"\n- \"made up\" → \"fabricated\"\n\nSimilarly, \"tasks\" → \"accomplish all these tasks\" – but the output isn't just changing \"tasks\" but rephrasing. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might require replacing certain phrases with their synonym counterparts. Let's check:\n\nInput 1: \"whole story\" → \"entire story\"; \"made up\" → \"fabricated\".\n\nInput 2: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" Here, \"do tasks\" becomes \"accomplish tasks\". So maybe the instruction involves changing verbs or verb phrases.\n\nInput 3: \"I think that...\" → \"It is my opinion that...\". Here, \"think\" is replaced with \"opinion\".\n\nInput 4: \"I can't tell the difference...\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish...\". \"Can't tell\" → \"find it hard to\". So the structure here is changed from an impossibility to a difficulty.\n\nInput 5: \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This is a complete restructuring from a greeting to a statement of anticipation.\n\nHmm, this is challenging because different transformations are happening in each example. Maybe there's a combination of approaches.\n\nAnother idea: The instruction could be to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, often involving replacing contractions (like \"I think\") with more formal phrases. Let's see:\n\n- \"I think that...\" → \"It is my opinion that...\": replacing \"I think\" with \"my opinion\" (formal).\n- \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\": replacing \"can you\" with \"would you be able to\" (more polite and formal).\n- \"See you...\" → \"I look forward to meeting you...\": turning a greeting into an anticipation, which is more formal than a casual \"see you\".\n\nIn example 1, there's no contraction to replace, but \"whole\" to \"entire\" might be a synonym choice. However, example 1's output doesn't match a standard synonym substitution. Similarly, example 4: \"can't tell\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\" doesn't fit a synonym replacement.\n\nSo perhaps part of the instruction is to replace certain words with their synonyms, especially when they relate to the context. For example, \"made up\" as in invention → \"fabricated\". But \"whole\" vs \"entire\" are synonyms but maybe more specific in context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or objective version, sometimes using different structures. For example:\n\n- Convert personal opinions to statements of fact or opinion.\n- Turn questions into more polite requests.\n- Replace colloquial expressions with more formal alternatives.\n- Convert greetings into expressions of anticipation.\n\nAnother observation: In example 3, the output starts with \"It is my opinion...\", which might be part of a larger instruction to rephrase statements in a way that credits the speaker's opinion. Similarly, in example 2, the output starts with \"Would you be able...\", which is a more polite request.\n\nWait, let's see if the outputs are always starting with \"It is my opinion...\" or similar. No, only example 3 does that. Other outputs start with similar but different phrases.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to rephrase the inputs by converting direct statements into indirect ones, sometimes adding more formal language. For example:\n\n- \"I think X\" → \"It is my opinion that X\"\n- \"Can you do Y?\" → \"Would you be able to Y?\"\n- \"I can't Z\" → \"I find it hard to Z\"\n\nBut why does \"See you...\" become \"I look forward to meeting you...\"? That's more of an anticipation than a rephrasing. Maybe the instruction was to turn greetings into expressions of looking forward, implying eagerness.\n\nAnother angle: All outputs seem to use more formal language. For example:\n\n- \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up\" (more formal)\n- \"accomplish\" vs \"do\" (same meaning but different verb choice)\n- \"my opinion\" vs \"I think\" (formal)\n- \"find it hard to distinguish\" vs \"can't tell the difference\" (more formal and precise)\n- \"look forward to meeting\" vs \"see you\" (formal and anticipatory)\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, often using more formal vocabulary and structure. However, the fifth example is a bit of a stretch because \"See you...\" is a greeting, and the output is more like a social expectation rather than formal politeness.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to convert each input into a passive voice construction. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: Input is active (\"was made up\"). Output is active (\"was fabricated\"). Not passive.\n\nExample 2: Input is active (\"Can you...\"). Output is active (\"Would you...\"). Passive isn't involved here.\n\nSo that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: The instruction might involve replacing certain phrases with their antonyms or opposites, but looking at the examples:\n\nExample 1: \"made up\" → \"fabricated\" – not opposites.\n\nExample 3: \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion\" – not opposites.\n\nSo that's probably not the case.\n\nPerhaps the instruction is to replace the original statement with a version that removes the speaker's perspective. For example:\n\n- Example 3: From \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\".\n- Example 2: Not sure if that fits.\n- Example 1: Not a perspective change.\n- Example 4: No perspective change.\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert direct questions into indirect ones, but only in cases where it's possible. For example, example 2 does that, but examples 1 and 3 don't involve questions.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to hypothesize that the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or professional version, often altering sentence structure to increase politeness or remove informality. For instance:\n\n- Using \"would be able to\" instead of \"can you\" (example 2).\n- Replacing contractions with full forms (though example 3 has \"I think\", which is a contraction).\n- Turning greetings into anticipation statements (example 5).\n- Using \"entire\" and \"fabricated\" as more formal terms (examples 1 and 2).\n- Changing \"I think\" to \"my opinion\" (example 3).\n- Reframing \"can't tell\" as \"find it hard to distinguish\" (example 4).\n\nBut why does example 3 only change the subject and not other parts? Maybe the instruction varies based on the input's nature. For example, for statements of belief, transform into opinions. For questions, rephrase as polite requests. For expressions of uncertainty, use phrases like \"find it hard to\".\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to turn the input into a version that's slightly more formal or objective, often by replacing certain phrases with their synonym counterparts. Let's check each example again with this in mind:\n\n1. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n   - \"whole\" → \"entire\", \"made up\" → \"fabricated\". These are synonyms, replacing with more formal terms.\n\n2. Input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n   - \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\", replacing \"do tasks\" with \"accomplish tasks\". So the structure is altered from a simple yes/no to a more indirect request, using \"able to\" and \"accomplish\".\n\n3. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n   - Changed \"I think\" to \"my opinion\". This makes it more of a reported statement rather than a personal assertion.\n\n4. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n   - \"can't tell\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\". More formal phrasing, shifting from impossibility to difficulty.\n\n5. Input: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n   - Completely changed structure from greeting to a statement expressing anticipation, which is more formal than a casual greeting.\n\nSo, the instruction could be a combination of different transformations depending on the input's type or content. For example:\n\n- When the input is a statement expressing belief/opinion (\"I think...\"), rephrase it as \"It is my opinion that...\".\n- When the input is a question, rephrase it as a more polite request (\"Would you be able to...\").\n- When the input expresses uncertainty (\"can't tell\"), rephrase it using \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n- When the input is a greeting (\"See you...\"), rephrase it into a more formal anticipation statement.\n- For noun phrases like \"whole story\", replace with more formal terms (\"entire\", \"fabricated\").\n\nBut this seems quite fragmented. Maybe there's a more overarching rule that I'm missing. Let's think again.\n\nAnother angle: All outputs are attempts to make the original statements more polite or formal. Let's see:\n\n1.

Let's start by looking at each input-output pair and see if there's a pattern or common transformation applied.\n\nFirst, the first input was \"She looks like her sister.\" The output became \"She resembles her sister.\" So here, the verb \"looks\" was replaced with \"resembles\". That makes sense because both words mean similar, but \"resembles\" is more formal. Maybe the instruction was to replace \"look\" with \"resemble\" in certain contexts?\n\nSecond example: Input \"Thanks for your help.\" Output \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" This seems like a rephrasing. Instead of directly thanking someone, it's expressing gratitude through recognition of their help. Perhaps the instruction was to convert thanks into a statement of appreciation?\n\nThird input: \"Please call once you get there.\" Output changed to \"Please call upon your arrival.\" Here, the phrase \"once you get there\" was rephrased as \"upon your arrival\". Both mean after arriving, but \"upon arrival\" sounds more formal. Maybe the task was to use more formal phrasing?\n\nFourth: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" The verb changed from \"stand\" to \"tolerate\", which also means enduring something. So replacing \"stand\" with \"tolerate\" might be part of the instruction.\n\nFifth: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Output \"Shall I accompany you?\" The question structure changed from \"Do you want...\" to \"Shall I...\". The first is a request for permission, the second is suggesting an action. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase questions about accompaniment into suggestions using \"shall\"?\n\nNow, putting this together, each input-output pair involves replacing certain verbs (like look -> resemble, stand -> tolerate) and restructuring sentences into more formal or polite expressions. The outputs seem to be more formal, polite, or rephrased versions of the original inputs.\n\nWait, but let's check if there's a general rule here. For instance, replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\" is a direct replacement. The second input turned a direct thank you into a more elaborate expression. The third changed \"call once you get there\" to \"call upon your arrival\", which is a slight shift in wording but keeps the meaning. The fourth uses \"cannot tolerate\" instead of \"can't stand\". The fifth changes the sentence structure from a question asking permission (\"Do you want...\") to a suggestion (\"Shall I...\").\n\nSo possible instruction could be: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly replacing specific verbs and adjusting sentence structure.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a more elevated or literary style. But looking at the examples, the changes vary: some are verb replacements, others are sentence restructuring.\n\nAnother angle: Could this be related to transforming imperative phrases into polite requests? For example, changing \"Please call once you get there\" to \"Please call upon your arrival\" is more formal. Similarly, \"Shall I accompany you?\" suggests a more formal or traditional phrasing.\n\nWait, the fifth example's output is using \"Shall I...\" which is a very old-fashioned or polite way to ask for permission or offer to do something. That's different from just making it more formal; it's specifically about formality and politeness levels.\n\nPutting all these observations together, the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or elevated version, possibly adjusting verb choices and sentence structures to fit different contexts (like more formal writing instead of casual).\n\nBut to confirm, let's think of another example. If the input was \"Can you pass the salt?\", the output might be \"May I assist you in passing the salt?\" But the given outputs don't show that. However, the fifth example does show a significant change in phrasing from a question about wanting accompaniment to a polite suggestion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a more literary or poetic version. But that seems less likely since the outputs don't show that level of transformation except in the first case where \"looks like\" becomes \"resembles\".\n\nWait, \"resembles\" is more formal than \"looks like\", so that fits. Similarly, \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" is a more formal way of saying \"Thanks for your help.\" So maybe the instruction was to replace informal expressions with more formal ones.\n\nLet me check the other outputs again. \"Please call once you get there\" becomes \"Please call upon your arrival.\" \"Upon your arrival\" is indeed more formal than \"once you get there.\" So that's another instance of using more formal language.\n\nThe fourth example's \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\" is another verb substitution for a similar meaning but more formal tone.\n\nThe fifth example's phrasing is a completely different structure, suggesting that not only the words but also the sentence structure was adjusted to a more formal level, perhaps even using archaic forms like \"Shall I accompany you?\" which is quite formal and old-fashioned.\n\nSo combining all these observations, the instruction was likely to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or elevated version of the original sentence. This would involve replacing certain verbs, adjusting sentence structures, and using more formal phrasing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate into another language and back, but that doesn't fit the examples. Or to make the outputs more elegant, but that's too vague.\n\nAnother possibility: The outputs are instances of converting contractions into full forms. For example, \"I can't stand\" to \"I cannot stand,\" but in the fifth example, the contraction isn't used. Wait, the fifth output is \"Shall I accompany you?\" which isn't directly related to contractions.\n\nHmm. The outputs vary in terms of structural changes. Let's list the transformations:\n\n1. Input: She looks like her sister. Output: She resembles her sister. (verb replacement)\n2. Input: Thanks for your help. Output: Your assistance is much appreciated. (rephrasing entire sentence)\n3. Input: Please call once you get there. Output: Please call upon your arrival. (verb replacement + minor restructuring)\n4. Input: I can't stand his temper. Output: I cannot tolerate his temper. (verb replacement)\n5. Input: Do you want me to go with you? Output: Shall I accompany you? (sentence structure change + verb replacement + formality)\n\nSo the instruction must cover various aspects: replacing certain verbs, rephrasing sentences into more formal terms, changing sentence structures (e.g., question to suggestion), and adjusting contractions.\n\nTo find the exact instruction, it's likely that the task was to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or literary version. The key elements are:\n\n- Using more formal vocabulary (e.g., \"resemble\" instead of \"look like\")\n- Restructuring sentences to sound more formal (e.g., \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"once you get there\")\n- Converting questions into suggestions or polite offers (like \"shall I accompany you?\")\n- Replacing contractions with full forms (\"cannot\" instead of \"can't\")\n\nTherefore, the original instruction probably stated that the friend should rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version by adjusting verb choices, sentence structures, and removing contractions.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to \"polish\" each sentence by making it more elegant or suitable for formal communication, which would encompass all the transformations observed.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was: **\"Rewrite each input into a more formal, polite, or elevated version, adjusting verb choices, sentence structures, and removing contractions as needed.\"**\n\n### Key Transformations Identified:\n1. **Verb Replacement**:  \n   - \"look\" → \"resemble\" (e.g., \"She looks like her sister\" → \"She resembles her sister\").  \n   - \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" (e.g., \"I can't stand his temper\" → \"I cannot tolerate his temper\").  \n\n2. **Sentence Restructuring**:  \n   - Casual phrases → Formal equivalents:  \n     - \"Once you get there\" → \"Upon your arrival\" (e.g., \"Please call once you get there\" → \"Please call upon your arrival\").  \n     - \"Shall I accompany you?\" uses an archaic formal structure.  \n\n3. **Politeness and Formality**:  \n   - Convert direct thanks (\"Thanks for your help\") into elaborate expressions of gratitude (\"Your assistance is much appreciated\").  \n   - Rephrase imperatives into polite requests (e.g., \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\").  \n\nThese transformations collectively align with the goal of elevating the language to a more formal register, emphasizing politeness, and restructuring sentences for clarity and formality.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs, and we need to deduce the general rule or transformation applied to each input to get the corresponding output. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each pair and see if there's a common pattern. Let me list them again:\n\n1. Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n2. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n3. Input: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\n4. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n5. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n\nLooking at these, I need to find a consistent rule that converts each input into its respective output. Let's break down each pair.\n\nStarting with the first one. The input is a negative statement about not doing anything, and the output is a suggestion rephrased in a more polite or formal way. The key here seems to be converting a negative expression into a positive suggestion using \"it is suggested that...\" and restructuring the sentence.\n\nSecond input: The output changes \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate.\" So it's replacing \"stand\" with \"tolerate,\" which might be part of a synonym replacement. But not all inputs follow this exact change. For example, the third input uses \"fire\" to mean good, but the second uses \"tolerate\" instead of \"stand.\" So maybe there's a mix of synonyms and different transformations.\n\nThird input: \"This song is fire\" becomes \"incredibly good.\" So here, \"fire\" is replaced with \"incredibly good.\" Similarly, maybe other expressions are being translated into more descriptive terms. But why \"incredibly\"? Maybe the output uses intensifiers. However, the fifth input also uses an intensifier: \"much appreciated\" compared to \"helps.\" Wait, the fifth input's output adds \"much\" as an intensifier. Hmm.\n\nFourth input: The output changes \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion that...\" which shifts the subject from \"I\" to \"It is my opinion,\" making it more indirect and formal. So perhaps turning first-person thoughts into a more objective or formal phrasing.\n\nFifth input: \"Thanks for your help\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Here, \"help\" is turned into \"assistance,\" which might be a synonym, and adding \"much\" as an intensifier.\n\nSo putting these together, the instruction likely involves three main elements:\n\n1. Rephrasing the input into a more formal or indirect tone.\n2. Using synonyms or more descriptive language to replace certain words or phrases.\n3. Possibly adding intensifiers like \"much\" or \"incredibly\" to amplify the positivity or emotion expressed.\n\nNow, checking if these elements apply to all pairs. Let's verify each input-output again:\n\n1. Input: Negative (\"don't think\") → Output: Suggestion (\"it is suggested\"). So converting a negative into a positive suggestion. The structure changes from first-person to passive voice with \"is suggested that.\"\n\n2. Input: \"can't stand\" → Output \"cannot tolerate.\" \"Stand\" vs. \"tolerate\" – synonyms. Also, \"his\" stays the same. So here, replacing \"stand\" with \"tolerate,\" which is a synonym but slightly different in nuance. Also, \"can't\" becomes \"cannot,\" which is grammatically more formal.\n\n3. Input: \"fire\" → \"incredibly good.\" So \"fire\" is slang meaning great, replaced with a more formal \"incredibly good.\" Adding \"incredibly\" as an intensifier. So replacing informal slang with a more descriptive phrase with an intensifier.\n\n4. Input: \"I think that...\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that...\" So shifting from first-person knowledge (\"I think\") to a more indirect expression of opinion (\"it is my opinion\"), which sounds more professional or neutral.\n\n5. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" So \"help\" becomes \"assistance\" (a synonym), and \"thanks\" becomes \"your assistance is much appreciated,\" which is a more formal way of expressing gratitude, adding \"much\" as an intensifier.\n\nSo looking for an instruction that would generate all these outputs. The common thread is transforming the input into a more formal or indirect style, possibly using synonyms, adding intensifiers, and changing sentence structures.\n\nThe instruction could be something like: \"Rephrase the given statement into a more formal tone by using synonyms, intensifiers, and rephrasing sentence structures.\" Alternatively, perhaps specific rules for each part, like changing negative suggestions into positive suggestions, replacing certain expressions with synonyms, adding intensifiers where necessary, and structuring opinions differently.\n\nWait, but how to fit all these into one instruction? Maybe the instruction was to rewrite each input by making it more polite or formal, using appropriate synonyms, intensifiers, and adjusting the sentence structure accordingly. For example, changing direct expressions into indirect ones, replacing informal terms with more formal ones, and adding emphasis where needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction involved identifying certain patterns in the input and replacing them systematically. For instance:\n\n- When a negative suggestion is made (\"don't think it's a good idea\"), rephrase it into a suggestion phrased as \"it is suggested that...\" without a negative.\n- Replace \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\" as synonyms.\n- Replace informal slang (\"fire\") with more descriptive positive adjectives, adding intensifiers.\n- Change \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\" to make it less direct.\n- Replace \"thanks for your help\" with \"your assistance is much appreciated\" to formalize the gratitude.\n\nBut how to combine all these into a single instruction? The most encompassing instruction would be: \"Rewrite the input into a more formal, indirect tone by replacing informal expressions with their formal equivalents, using appropriate intensifiers, and adjusting sentence structures where necessary.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction specified particular transformations for each type of input. For example:\n\n- Convert negative suggestions into positive suggestions using \"it is suggested that...\" and restructuring.\n- Replace \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\".\n- Replace \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\".\n- Replace \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion that...\".\n- Replace \"thanks for your help\" with \"Your assistance is much appreciated\".\n\nBut since the user says the friend received a single instruction and applied it to all inputs, the instruction must cover all these cases. Therefore, the instruction likely required applying a combination of strategies: rephrasing for formality, synonym substitution, intensification, and structural changes depending on the input's context.\n\nAnother angle: looking for consistent transformations across all examples. For instance, all outputs seem to be rephrased in a more formal or indirect manner. Let's check each output:\n\n1. Original negative → formal suggestion.\n2. Replace \"stand\" with \"tolerate\"; both are negative, but phrased formally.\n3. Replace informal slang \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\", adding \"incredibly\" as intensifier.\n4. Replace \"I think\" with \"my opinion\".\n5. Replace \"help\" with \"assistance\", add \"much appreciated\".\n\nThe common theme here is transforming the input into a more polite, formal, or indirect version while maintaining the original meaning. So the instruction could have been: \"Polish the statement to make it more formal, polite, or indirect by replacing informal expressions with their more refined counterparts, adjusting grammar, and using appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have specified to convert negative suggestions into positive recommendations, replace certain verbs with synonyms, add intensifiers where applicable, and adjust sentence structures like moving subject or modifying personal opinions.\n\nGiven that all examples require some form of transformation that results in a more formal or indirect phrasing, the most comprehensive instruction would likely involve rewriting each input into a more formal tone, using appropriate synonyms, intensifiers, and sentence adjustments as needed. The friend was instructed to take each input and rephrase it in a way that is more polite, formal, or indirect, maintaining the original message but altering the style and structure.\n\nThus, the original instruction was probably along the lines of: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal tone by replacing informal expressions with their more polite equivalents, adjusting grammar, and using appropriate intensifiers where necessary.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe original instruction required rewriting each input into a **more formal and indirect tone** by applying systematic transformations. The key steps were:\n\n1. **Polish Formality**: Convert direct statements into more polite or neutral phrasing.  \n   - Example: Replace \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\"; adjust \"don’t think\" into \"suggested that...\"  \n\n2. **Synonym Substitution**: Use formal synonyms for informal or emotionally charged terms.  \n   - Example: Replace \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\"; swap \"help\" with \"assistance\".  \n\n3. **Intensifiers**: Amplify positive or emotional nuances with words like \"much\", \"incredibly\".  \n   - Example: Add \"much appreciated\" to \"Thanks for your help\".  \n\n4. **Structural Adjustments**: Restructure sentences to avoid first-person perspective or direct opinions.  \n   - Example: Rewrite \"I think\" as \"It is my opinion that...\".  \n\n**Final Instruction:**  \n\"Rewrite each input into a more formal and indirect tone by replacing informal expressions with polite equivalents, adjusting grammar, and using appropriate intensifiers as needed.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs where their friend transformed each input into the given output. My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction that would explain all these transformations. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the patterns in each input and see how they were altered. Let's list out the inputs and outputs again to compare.\n\n1. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\"\n   Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n\n2. Input: \"I got what you said.\"\n   Output: \"I understood you.\"\n\n3. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n   Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\n4. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\"\n   Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n\n5. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\"\n   Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n\nLooking at these, I notice different changes. Let's break them down sentence by sentence.\n\n1. The first input uses \"can't tell the difference\" which is converted to \"find it hard to distinguish.\" Both express difficulty in telling apart two things. The structure changes from negative to more formal, maybe using \"find it hard to...\" instead of \"can't tell the difference between...\".\n\n2. The second input uses \"got what you said,\" changed to \"understood you.\" The original is colloquial, using \"got\" as understanding. The output uses more formal \"understood.\"\n\n3. The third input has \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output adds \"whom\" before \"I met.\" So the relative clause changes from using a non-restrictive \"I met yesterday\" (since \"was helpful\" doesn't specify which lawyer) but adding \"whom\" makes it sound more formal or perhaps emphasizes the person met.\n\n4. The fourth input is a question: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" The output converts it into a suggestion with \"Shall I accompany you?\" So the structure shifts from a direct question (\"do you want\") to a polite offer (\"shall I\").\n\n5. The fifth input uses \"I think that...\" which becomes \"It is my opinion that...\" This turns the personal opinion into a more formal phrasing, elevating the perspective from first-person to third-person and using \"my opinion\" as a wrapper.\n\nNow, considering all these transformations, there are a few possible directions the instruction could have gone. Let's hypothesize:\n\n- The instruction might be asking to rephrase the input into a more formal or standard English version. For example, converting contractions to full forms, replacing informal expressions with more formal ones, correcting grammar structures, etc.\n\nBut looking closer:\n\nIn the first pair, changing \"can't tell\" to \"find it hard\" is a bit more formal. Similarly, \"got what you said\" becomes \"understood you,\" which is still informal but less so than \"got.\" The third input adds \"whom,\" which is a formal relative pronoun. The fourth input's question is turned into a polite suggestion. The fifth is transformed into a passive voice construction.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a passive voice? But not all outputs are passive. The third output is passive (\"was helpful\"), but others aren't. The fifth output uses \"it is my opinion that,\" which is not a passive voice.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to make the sentences more polite or formal. Let's check:\n\nFirst input: From casual to slightly formal. Second input: Casual to somewhat formal. Third: Non-restrictive relative clause to formal with \"whom.\" Fourth: Direct question to polite request. Fifth: Personal opinion to formal statement.\n\nSo possible instruction: Make the sentences more polite and formal. That seems plausible. Let's test if this fits all examples.\n\nFirst input: The original is slightly informal (\"can't tell\"). Changing to \"find it hard to distinguish\" makes it more formal. Output matches.\n\nSecond input: \"Got what you said\" is very casual. Changing to \"understood you\" is more neutral, but not sure. However, the original uses present perfect, which might be why \"understood\" is past tense. Wait, the original is \"I got what you said\" – present perfect, so \"understood\" would be past tense. The output is \"understood you\" – present tense? Wait, no. Wait, the input is \"got\" (past tense), output is \"understood\" (past tense). So maybe converting to \"understood you\" instead of \"got what you said.\" Hmm, but why? Maybe the instruction was to replace colloquialisms with more formal verbs. But \"understood\" is more formal than \"got\" perhaps. But \"got\" is already pretty informal. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the entire sentence in a more formal way. But \"understood you\" is still pretty direct.\n\nThird input: The original uses a non-restrictive \"I met yesterday\" (since it's modifying \"lawyer\"), but the output adds \"whom,\" making it restrictive. Wait, \"whom I met yesterday\" could be considered a restrictive clause because the reason why the lawyer was helpful is specified by the time, but grammatically, the original is non-restrictive because it's after a past participle. Adding \"whom\" turns it into a restrictive clause, but actually, that might not be correct. Because \"I met yesterday\" is a postpositive modifier indicating when the meeting happened. Without \"whom,\" it's a non-restrictive clause. Adding \"whom\" would make it restrictive, but that's not the case here. Wait, maybe the output is just adding \"whom\" without changing the meaning. Because the original is saying the lawyer met yesterday was helpful. The output says the same thing, but using \"whom\" to indicate that the subject is the lawyer. Maybe the original is a bit unclear, so adding \"whom\" clarifies. But I'm not sure if that's the intended change. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the sentence with a different relative pronoun, but in this case, it's changing \"who\" to \"whom,\" which is more formal.\n\nFourth input: Converting \"Do you want me to...\" into \"Shall I...\" is a common formalization technique in questions, moving from the tentative \"do you want\" to the more formal \"shall I accompany you.\"\n\nFifth input: Changing \"I think that...\" to \"It is my opinion that...\" elevates the perspective, making it a third-person statement about the speaker's opinion.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction seems to be to transform the input into a more formal, polite, or elevated style of writing. Each output example fits into that category. Let's verify if there are any other possibilities.\n\nAlternative possibilities: Could it be about correcting grammar errors? For example, the third input had a missing comma before \"was helpful,\" but the output doesn't address that. The first output doesn't fix grammar. So probably not.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the instruction was to convert statements into questions or vice versa. But looking at the outputs, none of them are questions except the fourth one. So that's inconsistent.\n\nOr maybe to rephrase negations? Like \"I can't\" to \"I find it hard,\" but that's part of the first transformation. Not sure.\n\nWait, another observation: All outputs seem to avoid the original sentence structures. For instance, the third input uses \"that\" to introduce the clause, while the output uses \"that\" as well. No change there. The first input's \"between these two\" vs \"between them\"—maybe a generalization of the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to make the sentences more concise. But the outputs are longer in some cases, like the first input becoming longer. Not likely.\n\nAnother angle: The first input's output replaces \"these two\" with \"them,\" which is a generalization. The third input's output adds \"whom,\" which specifies the person. The fifth input's output replaces \"this is\" with \"it is my opinion that,\" which shifts the focus.\n\nWait, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentence in a more objective tone. The first input becomes more descriptive. The third input, by adding \"whom,\" might clarify who exactly the lawyer is, making it more specific. The fifth input removes \"I think\" and adds \"my opinion,\" which could be seen as removing subjectivity but in this case, it's the opposite—stating a personal opinion in a more formal way.\n\nPutting all this together, the most consistent pattern is that each output is a more formal, polite, and possibly elevated version of the input. This would explain all the transformations. For example:\n\n- Colloquialisms (like \"got what you said\") are replaced with more formal terms (\"understood you\").\n- Short phrases are expanded into longer, more formal equivalents (\"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish between them\").\n- Casual questions are turned into polite offers (\"do you want me to...?\" → \"shall I accompany you?\").\n- Personal opinions are framed as formal statements of opinion (\"I think that...\" → \"it is my opinion that...\").\n\nTherefore, the instruction likely asked the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version, maintaining the same meaning but using more elevated language and structures.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, and elevated version of the sentence**, adjusting vocabulary, structure, and tone to enhance formality or politeness. Each output reflects this transformation, as seen through:\n\n1. **Colloquialisms to Formality**:  \n   - \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\" (substituting \"got\" with a neutral verb).\n   - \"Do you want me to...\" → \"Shall I...\" (converting a direct question into a polite suggestion).\n\n2. **Increased Detail and Precision**:  \n   - \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish between them\" (expanding the phrase for clarity).\n   - \"I met yesterday\" → \"whom I met yesterday\" (adding specificity via \"whom\" to clarify the relationship).\n\n3. **Elevated Perspective**:  \n   - \"I think that...\" → \"It is my opinion that...\" (rephrasing personal belief into a formal, third-person assertion).\n\nBy systematically transforming inputs to meet these criteria, the friend produced outputs that align with the instruction's goal of fostering formality and politeness.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs where a friend transformed each input into an output using some kind of rule or transformation. My job is to reverse-engineer that instruction based on these examples.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\n1. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nHmm, here the original sentence didn't have a relative clause. The output adds \"whom\" after \"lawyer\". Wait, but \"whom\" is used as the object of a verb or preposition. In the original input, \"I met\" uses \"me\", not \"whom\". So maybe the instruction is about converting possessive pronouns into objective case? But in this example, \"my\" wasn't there, so that might not be it.\n\nWait, no. The output here changes \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because \"whom\" is the object form. If someone says \"I met him\", it would become \"him whom\", which isn't correct. Maybe the instruction is to replace \"I met\" with \"whom I met\"? But that seems odd. Let me check other examples.\n\n2. Input: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\nSo \"fire\" is replaced with \"incredibly good\". \"Fire\" is a colloquial term meaning something is great or awesome. The output uses a more formal synonym. So maybe the instruction is to translate informal expressions into more formal synonyms?\n\n3. Third input: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n\"Once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival\". \"Upon arrival\" is a more formal way to say that. So perhaps the instruction is to replace certain phrases with more formal alternatives?\n\n4. Fourth input: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\nHere, the output is a common expression that's considered more polite. The original is a casual \"see you\" and the response. So maybe the instruction is to convert casual expressions into more formal or expected responses?\n\n5. Fifth input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n\"Looks like\" is a colloquial way to say \"resembles\". So replacing colloquial expressions with their more standard alternatives.\n\nLooking at all these transformations:\n\n- First example: changing the pronoun structure? But how?\nWait, the first input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So they added \"whom\" after \"lawyer\". But in the original, \"I met\" uses \"me\", not \"whom\". Wait, that's confusing. Unless the instruction is to replace \"I\" with \"me\" when it's part of a noun phrase? Or maybe it's adding the relative pronoun because \"I met\" is the subject of the clause, so the relative pronoun should be \"who\". Wait, the original has \"I met\" as the subject, so the relative clause should use \"who\". But the output uses \"whom\". That doesn't make sense. Maybe the error is in my analysis.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the first pair:\n\nInput: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nOutput: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\nSo the structure here is \"The lawyer [relative clause] was helpful.\" The relative clause is \"whom I met yesterday\". So \"whom\" is the object of \"met\", hence correct. The original input uses \"I met\", which is the subject of the relative clause. But in English, when the subject is a person (I/me), the relative pronoun should be \"who\" (for the subject) or \"whom\" (for the object). However, in this case, \"I met\" is part of the main clause, and the relative clause is \"whom I met yesterday\", which refers back to the lawyer. So the subject of \"met\" is \"whom\" (the lawyer), making \"whom\" correct. But why did the output add \"whom\" to the original input, which already had \"I met\"? That seems like a mistake. Unless the instruction was to convert possessive pronouns to objective case? For example, \"her\" to \"him\", but in the first example, there's no possessive. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert possessive pronouns to their object forms when referring to people? Like changing \"my\" to \"myself\", but that's not happening here. Or perhaps the instruction was to add a relative pronoun where none existed before? That doesn't seem to fit. Maybe the examples were miswritten. Wait, looking again at the first input-output pair:\n\nOriginal Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nOutput: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the instruction was to add the relative pronoun \"whom\" to the subject noun phrase when the subject is a person? But that's not a standard rule. Normally, we use \"who\" as the subject of a relative clause. For example, \"The lawyer who I met was helpful.\" But in the output, it's \"whom\". So that seems contradictory. Maybe there's a typo in the input or output. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"me\" when following a verb? But in the first example, \"I met\" is followed by \"yesterday\", not a verb.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert \"I\" to \"myself\", but that's not the case here. Or perhaps the instruction is to use more formal language. Wait, the fifth example does that (\"She looks like her sister.\" becomes \"She resembles her sister.\"). So maybe the instruction is to replace informal expressions with more formal ones.\n\nLet me check each example against possible instructions:\n\n1. \"Replace 'I' with 'me'\" – but in the first example, the input uses \"I met\", and the output adds \"whom\". Doesn't fit.\n\n2. \"Translate informal slang to more formal equivalents\" – second example fits (fire→incredibly good).\n\n3. \"Replace casual phrases with more formal or traditional alternatives\" – third example (\"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\"), fourth (\"see you\" → \"look forward to meeting you\"), fifth (\"looks like\" → \"resembles\").\n\nIf that's the case, then the instruction might be to convert informal expressions into more formal or standard phrasing. However, the first example doesn't fit unless there's a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the first example is not an actual transformation. Let me re-examine:\n\nInput: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\nThe output adds \"whom\" after \"lawyer\". But why? The original doesn't have a relative clause. Wait, the structure here is \"The lawyer [subject] was helpful.\" The subject is \"lawyer\", which is a noun. Then the relative clause is \"whom I met yesterday\", which modifies \"lawyer\". Since \"I met\" is the subject of the relative clause, the relative pronoun should be \"who\". But the output uses \"whom\", which is incorrect unless the instruction was to add \"whom\" for some reason. This might be an error in the input/output pair. Alternatively, maybe the original input had a different structure. For example, perhaps the input was missing punctuation or had a typo.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to add a possessive pronoun or reflexive pronoun where applicable. But the first example doesn't have that. Or perhaps the instruction is to convert the main clause into a subordinate clause. But that doesn't explain the examples.\n\nLooking at the second example: \"This song is fire.\" → \"This song is incredibly good.\" So \"fire\" is a slang term for something being great, replaced with a more formal synonym. This could be part of a larger instruction to convert colloquial expressions into more formal language.\n\nThird example: \"Please call once you get there.\" → \"Please call upon your arrival.\" Here, \"once you get there\" is a less formal way of saying \"upon your arrival\". So replacing casual phrasing with more formal alternatives.\n\nFourth example: \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" A typical formal response to \"see you\" is to express anticipation, so this conversion makes sense.\n\nFifth example: \"She looks like her sister.\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" Replacing the colloquial \"looks like\" with the more formal \"resembles\".\n\nPutting this together, the instruction likely involves converting informal or colloquial expressions into more formal, standard, or traditional phrasing. However, the first example seems to be an exception. Maybe the first example is actually correct, but my initial analysis is wrong.\n\nWait, in the first input-output pair, the output adds \"whom\" to the beginning. Let's parse both sentences:\n\nOriginal input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → The subject is \"The lawyer\", followed by a past participle phrase \"I met yesterday\". Wait, but that's not a valid construction. Because \"met\" is a verb, and \"yesterday\" is an adverb. So the structure is \"The lawyer [past participle phrase] was helpful.\" That doesn't make sense. Maybe the original input is missing some punctuation or there's a typo. For example, maybe the input was supposed to be \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" and the output adds \"whom\" to make it a relative clause: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" But why would that happen? The original doesn't have a relative clause. Maybe the instruction was to add a relative pronoun to a noun phrase when referring to a specific instance? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to use more formal language by replacing contractions or informal terms. But the first example doesn't involve a contraction. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to add a possessive pronoun to the noun. For example, \"Lawyer I met\" becomes \"Lawyer whom I met\". But that's still unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the first example is not about grammar but about changing the pronoun from subject to object. For instance, changing \"I met\" to \"whom met\" doesn't make sense. But \"whom\" is the object. Wait, if the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"me\" in certain contexts, but the first example doesn't have \"I\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the entire sentence into a relative clause. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to add the relative pronoun after the noun when it refers to a specific person mentioned earlier. For example, if the input refers to a previous mention of a lawyer, but in the given input, there's no such context. The input is standalone.\n\nGiven that the second example fits a pattern of replacing slang with more formal terms, and the third, fourth, and fifth also do, perhaps the first example is either a typo or an exception. However, since the first example doesn't fit, perhaps the instruction is more general.\n\nWait, another angle: looking at the outputs, all of them start with a similar structure. For example, the outputs often start with the noun phrase and then a formal replacement. Let's look:\n\n1. Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" → The structure here is [noun] [relative pronoun + verb phrase].\n\n2. Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\" → [subject] [verb] [adjective]\n\n3. Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\" → [verb] [prep phrase]\n\n4. Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" → [subject] [verb phrase]\n\n5. Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" → [subject] [verb]\n\nNot sure. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal structure by replacing certain words or phrases with their formal equivalents.\n\nFor example, in the second example, \"fire\" is replaced with \"incredibly good\". Similarly, \"once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival\". \"See you\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you\", which is a formal greeting. \"Looks like\" becomes \"resembles\". \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\" (though that seems grammatically incorrect, but maybe it's part of a relative clause instruction).\n\nWait, if the instruction is to create a relative clause when referring to a specific instance, perhaps the input was supposed to include a previous mention. But the inputs are all standalone. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the subject into a relative clause structure. For example, changing \"The lawyer I met...\" to \"The lawyer whom I met...\", which adds a relative pronoun. But why would that be the case? That doesn't seem to serve a linguistic purpose.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to change \"I\" to \"me\" whenever it follows a linking verb or action verb. But in the first example, \"was helpful\" is a linking verb phrase. So \"I was helpful\" would become \"me was helpful\", which is not correct. That doesn't align.\n\nWait, perhaps the instruction is to use more formal language by replacing contractions or using more precise wording. For example, \"I met\" is non-contracted and uses the full form. Maybe the instruction was to ensure all pronouns are in their base form and avoid contractions. But in the first example, there are no contractions. The output doesn't have any, but the input didn't either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert present tense verbs into future tense? But in the third example, \"call once\" becomes \"call upon your arrival\", which is present tense. The fourth example is similar.\n\nAnother thought: looking at the third example, \"Please call once you get there.\" becomes \"Please call upon your arrival.\" So \"once you get there\" is changed to \"upon your arrival\". Similarly, \"See you tonight.\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" So the instruction might be to replace casual expressions with more formal alternatives commonly used in polite communication.\n\nThe fifth example is replacing \"looks like\" with \"resembles\", which is a more formal synonym.\n\nThe second example replaces a colloquial slang term (\"fire\") with a more formal adjective.\n\nThe first example, despite not fitting the others, adds a relative pronoun, which could be part of making a more formal or specific reference. Maybe the instruction was to convert the sentence into a relative clause to make it more specific or formal.\n\nBut why would \"I met yesterday\" become \"whom I met yesterday\"? If the instruction was to make the sentence more formal by using relative clauses, perhaps in cases where the referent is a specific individual mentioned earlier. But without context, that's hard to justify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert the subject into a relative clause structure by adding \"whom\" for people. But that's not a standard grammatical rule. Normally, you use \"who\" as the subject of a relative clause and \"whom\" as the object.\n\nWait, the first output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the relative clause is \"whom I met yesterday\", modifying \"lawyer\". Since \"I met\" is the subject of the relative clause, the relative pronoun should be \"who\". But here it's \"whom\", which is incorrect. So unless there's a misunderstanding here, this example might be an error. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert possessive pronouns to object form, but in this case, there are none.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to add a possessive pronoun to the subject. For example, \"The lawyer I met\" becomes \"The lawyer's whom I met\". But that doesn't fit the example.\n\nGiven the inconsistencies in the first example and the prevalence of other examples matching a pattern of replacing informal with formal language, I'm leaning towards the instruction being to translate informal or colloquial expressions into more formal, standard, or polite alternatives. This would account for the second, third, fourth, and fifth examples. The first example might be an exception, possibly due to a typo or misunderstanding in the input-output pair.\n\nBut wait, maybe the first example is actually part of the same pattern. Let's think differently: perhaps the instruction is to make the noun phrase more specific by adding a relative clause. For example, \"The lawyer I met yesterday\" is made more formal by adding \"whom I met yesterday\", even though grammatically it's incorrect. But why would that be the case? It might not be the intended instruction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to add a possessive pronoun after the noun. For example, \"The lawyer I met\" → \"The lawyer's I met\", but that doesn't make sense. Or maybe \"The lawyer I met\" → \"The lawyer that I met\", but that's introducing a different relative pronoun.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"me\" in certain contexts. But in the first example, there's no \"I\" to replace. The input uses \"I met\", which is part of a past participle phrase, not a subject. Wait, \"I met\" here is part of the past participle phrase modified by the relative clause. Wait, no, the structure is \"The lawyer [past participle phrase] was helpful.\" But that doesn't make sense because \"met\" is a past tense verb, not a past participle. A past participle would be something like \"met\" in \"the lawyer met yesterday\". But in this case, \"met\" is a past tense verb modifying \"lawyer\", so \"lawyer met yesterday\" would be a noun phrase with an adjective-like usage. So the structure is \"The lawyer [past tense phrase] was helpful.\" But that's not a standard noun phrase structure.\n\nThis suggests that the first example might have been miswritten or there's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the input was \"The lawyer I met yesterday\" (without the \"was helpful\"), and the output adds \"was helpful\". But that still doesn't clarify the transformation.\n\nGiven the uncertainty about the first example, I'll focus on the other four, which all show a trend towards replacing informal expressions with more formal ones. The fifth example is the only one that's a direct synonym replacement, while the others involve phrase substitutions. \n\nTherefore, the most plausible instruction is: **\"Replace informal or colloquial expressions with more formal, standard, or traditionally correct phrasing.\"**\n\nTo confirm, let's check each example against this instruction:\n\n1. **Input:** \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → **Output:** \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"  \n   If the instruction is to replace informal phrasing, this example seems out of place. However, maybe \"I met\" is considered informal and the output uses a more formal way of expressing the same thing. But \"whom I met\" is still part of the informal structure. This example is puzzling.\n\n2. **Input:** \"This song is fire.\" → **Output:** \"This song is incredibly good.\"  \n   Fire is slang, replaced with a more formal adjective.\n\n3. **Input:** \"Please call once you get there.\" → **Output:** \"Please call upon your arrival.\"  \n   Casual phrase replaced with a formal alternative.\n\n4. **Input:** \"See you tonight.\" → **Output:** \"I look forward to",

The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs.\nHere are the input-output pairs:\n\nInput: Thanks for your help.\nOutput: Your assistance is much appreciated.\n\nInput: The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful. \nOutput: The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\n\nInput: I considered many approaches.\nOutput: Various approaches were considered.\n\nInput: See you tonight.\nOutput: I look forward to meeting you tonight.\n\nInput: This song is fire.\nOutput: This song is incredibly good.\n\nThe instruction was<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<|begin_of_thought|>Okay, let's try to figure out what the original instruction might have been. The friend provided outputs for each input by converting them into different forms or adding certain elements. Let's analyze each pair step by step.\n\nStarting with the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"Thanks for your help.\"\nOutput: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\nHmm. So the input is a simple thank you, and the output turns it into a more formal or polite response. The output changes \"help\" to \"assistance,\" adds \"is much appreciated.\" Maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentence using more formal language or turn it into a longer, more elaborate expression of gratitude. But let me check other pairs to see if there's a pattern.\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nOutput: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nHere, the output changes the possessive \"my\" to \"whom.\" So the original had \"I met\" but added \"whom\" after removing \"my.\" Wait, no—the input says \"I met,\" and the output says \"whom I met.\" So the instruction might have been to convert \"I\" to \"whom\" in a relative clause. But that seems specific. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to make the sentence passive? Let's check the next input.\n\nThird input:\nInput: \"I considered many approaches.\"\nOutput: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\nAh, here the output changes the subject from \"I\" to \"Various approaches\" and adds \"were.\" So maybe the instruction was to convert the active voice into passive voice. But the first pair didn't match, so perhaps not. Or maybe it's about restructuring the sentence differently, like adding modifiers or changing subject pronouns.\n\nFourth input:\nInput: \"See you tonight.\"\nOutput: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\nThe output is transformed into a more formal expression of anticipation. The original is casual, the output is more structured and positive. So maybe the instruction was to rewrite casual expressions into more polite, formal equivalents.\n\nFifth input:\nInput: \"This song is fire.\"\nOutput: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\nThis converts slang (\"fire\") into a more standard praise. So the instruction might involve replacing informal expressions with more formal or descriptive terms.\n\nNow, putting all these transformations together, what common thread connects them? Let's think:\n\n1. The first pair transforms a direct thank you into a longer, more formal expression of gratitude. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase expressions of thanks into more elaborate ones.\n2. The second pair changes \"my\" to \"whom\" in a relative clause. That's a specific grammatical change. But why would the input be \"I met\" and output \"whom I met\"? Unless the instruction was to use \"whom\" instead of \"who\" where appropriate. But the first example doesn't fit that unless \"your\" becomes \"your assistance,\" which it does. Wait, maybe the original instruction was to replace possessive adjectives with more formal terms, or to rephrase common phrases.\n3. Third input: changing active to passive voice. Input uses \"I considered,\" output is passive: \"were considered.\" But the first example doesn't fit. So maybe passive isn't it.\n4. Fourth input: turning casual greetings into formal ones. So maybe converting casual phrases into more polite, structured alternatives.\n5. Fifth input: replacing slang with standard praise.\n\nAlternatively, looking at all the outputs, they seem to add more words, make sentences more elaborate, or replace certain phrases. Let's see the verbs involved:\n\nFirst input uses \"was,\" but the output adds \"is much appreciated.\"\nSecond uses \"was,\" but the output adds \"were considered.\"\nWait, third output uses passive voice: \"were considered.\"\nFourth uses \"look forward to,\" which is a longer verb phrase.\nFifth replaces \"is fire\" with \"is incredibly good.\"\n\nSo possible instruction could be: \"Convert each input into a more formal or elaborated version, possibly using different verb tenses, longer structures, or more descriptive adjectives.\"\n\nBut let's check the second pair again. The input was \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, \"whom\" is used instead of \"I\" (but wait, the input says \"I met,\" so changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\"—that's adding \"whom\" and changing \"me\" to \"met\"? No, wait, the input is \"I met,\" but the output is \"whom I met.\" So the original \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met.\" So this could be converting \"I met\" into a relative clause with \"whom\" as the object. But why would the input be just \"I met\" and the output \"whom I met\"? That doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace \"my\" with \"whose\" or another possessive? But in the first example, \"your\" becomes \"your assistance.\" Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the instruction was to convert \"I\" to \"you\" or vice versa, but looking at the outputs:\n\nFirst output starts with \"Your assistance,\" so \"you\" is mentioned. But the input was directed at the speaker. Maybe the instruction was to personalize the response by using \"you\" instead of \"I\"? For example, taking the original statements and rewriting them from the perspective of the person being addressed.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis:\n\nOriginal input: \"Thanks for your help.\" Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" So the input is directed at the listener (\"Thanks for your help\"), and the output is directed back to them (\"Your assistance...\"). Similarly, the second input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, the output uses \"I\" (the speaker) but in the input it's \"I met,\" so maybe the instruction was to change the subject from first to third person?\n\nBut in the first case, the input is \"your\" and the output uses \"your assistance,\" so maybe the instruction was to turn the direct address into a more formal mention. For example, replacing \"your\" with \"your assistance\" when expressing gratitude.\n\nAnother angle: the outputs seem to sometimes use more formal language, longer phrases, or change sentence structure. For example, turning \"See you tonight.\" into \"I look forward to meeting you...\" which is a more formal way to express the same sentiment. Similarly, \"This song is fire\" becomes \"incredibly good,\" which is more descriptive.\n\nPutting all this together, perhaps the instruction was: \"Convert each input into a more formal, polite, or elaborated version. Use more detailed descriptions, replace contractions with full forms, and adjust sentence structure for clarity and formality.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into its antonym or opposite meaning, but looking at the examples:\n\nFirst input's output is more positive (gratitude). Second input's output removes \"my\" and adds \"whom,\" which could be seen as making it more objective. Third input becomes passive. Fourth becomes more formal. Fifth becomes a more positive description. None of these are opposites, so that's not it.\n\nWait, another approach: look for the most common transformation. For example, the first output adds \"is much appreciated\" to \"Thanks for your help.\" The third output changes \"I considered\" to \"Various approaches were considered.\" So in that case, the subject is changed from \"I\" to \"Various approaches,\" and \"considered\" becomes passive with \"were considered.\" That's passive voice. Let's check other pairs:\n\nSecond input: \"was helpful\" becomes \"was helpful\" (no change there). First and third: different changes. Fourth: \"See you...\" becomes \"I look forward to...\" (active to active, but more formal). Fifth: \"is fire\" to \"is incredibly good\" (replace slang with more positive adjective).\n\nHmm, maybe the instruction was to convert the first-person singular into a more formal version, either passive voice or using collective nouns/subjects. For example, \"I considered\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" So changing the subject to something more general or collective, and using passive voice. Similarly, the second input, \"whom\" added after removing \"my\" could be part of a relative clause, but why?\n\nAlternatively, considering the outputs, maybe the instruction was to turn each input into its opposite. But how? Let's check:\n\nInput 1: \"Thanks for your help.\" Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" These aren't opposites. So probably not.\n\nAnother thought: the outputs seem to often add more words or phrases. For instance:\n\n- \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" (adds \"is much appreciated\")\n- \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" (adds \"whom\" and \"was helpful\")\n- \"Various approaches were considered.\" (changes subject from \"I\" to \"approaches\" and adds \"were considered\")\n- \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" (adds \"I look forward to...\")\n- \"This song is incredibly good.\" (adds \"incredibly good\")\n\nSo each output is an expansion or modification of the input. Let's consider possible instructions that could lead to such transformations:\n\n1. Convert to passive voice.\n2. Personalize the response with \"your\" or \"you.\"\n3. Use more formal language.\n4. Add descriptive adjectives or phrases.\n5. Change subject pronoun to third person or collective.\n\nLooking at the third input/output pair: input is \"I considered many approaches.\" Output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" Here, the subject changes from \"I\" to \"Various approaches,\" and the verb becomes passive \"were considered.\" So that suggests passive voice conversion. But in the first input, the output doesn't use passive. So maybe not always.\n\nThe fourth input/output: \"See you...\" becomes \"I look forward to...\" which is a more formal way to express anticipation. So that's a change from casual to formal.\n\nThe fifth input/output: replacing \"fire\" with \"incredibly good.\" So maybe replacing informal expressions with more standard or positive terms.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction might have been: \"For each input, rephrase it into a more formal or polite version. Expand or modify the sentence to add more details, use different verb forms (like passive), or replace informal terms with more descriptive ones.\"\n\nBut the second input/output seems specific: changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met.\" Let's parse that. The original input was \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So here, the instruction might have been to use \"whom\" instead of \"who\" when referring to people in relative clauses, but why remove \"my\"? Because \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\"? That doesn't align with standard grammar. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to remove possessives and add more descriptive prepositional phrases. For example, changing \"my\" to \"of me\" but that doesn't fit here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to change \"my\" to \"one's\" or another possessive, but looking at the first output, \"your\" becomes \"your assistance,\" which is a noun phrase rather than a possessive adjective.\n\nWait, in the first output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" So \"your\" in the input becomes \"your assistance\" in the output. That could mean that the instruction was to turn the direct object (\"help\") into a noun phrase with a possessive adjective. For example, replacing \"help\" with \"your assistance,\" \"his guidance,\" etc. But does that apply to other inputs? Let's check:\n\nInput 2: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So here, \"helpful\" becomes \"was helpful,\" but the structure is similar. Doesn't fit the first pattern.\n\nThird input: \"I considered many approaches.\" Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\" Again, subject changed from \"I\" to \"approaches,\" verb tense and voice changed.\n\nFourth input: \"See you tonight.\" Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" Here, the input is a greeting, output is a more formal response.\n\nFifth input: \"This song is fire.\" Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\" Slang to more descriptive praise.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input in multiple ways, expanding or rephrasing, but based on common transformations observed. However, since all outputs must correspond to the same instruction, we need to find a single instruction that explains all these diverse outputs.\n\nWait, perhaps the instruction was to convert each input into its reciprocal or some kind of opposite meaning, but none of the outputs seem to invert the meaning. For example, \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" is positive, matching the input's tone.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to transform each input into its passive voice equivalent. Let's check:\n\nInput 1: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Passive would be \"Your help was thanked for.\" But the output is different.\n\nInput 2: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Passive would be \"I was helped by the lawyer I met yesterday.\" Doesn't match the output.\n\nInput 3: \"I considered many approaches.\" Passive: \"Many approaches were considered by me.\" Output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" Close, but \"many\" vs \"various,\" and \"were considered by me\" vs passive without \"by.\" So not exactly passive.\n\nInput 4: \"See you tonight.\" Passive: \"You will be seen tonight.\" Not matching output.\n\nInput 5: \"This song is fire.\" Passive: \"Fire is this song.\" Doesn't match output.\n\nSo passive voice might not be the answer.\n\nAnother angle: personalization. The first output uses \"Your,\" the second uses \"whom,\" the fourth uses \"I,\" the fifth uses \"you.\" Maybe the instruction was to insert the second person pronoun wherever possible, making the response more directed at the listener. For example:\n\n- Input 1: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output starts with \"Your assistance...\"\n- Input 2: \"The lawyer I met...\" → Output \"The lawyer whom I met...\" (maybe replacing \"I\" with \"me\" when necessary?)\nWait, the output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the original had \"I met,\" but the output says \"whom I met.\" This doesn't fit a simple replacement. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to add \"whom\" after the noun when referring to the subject who performed the action. Like, in the sentence \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful,\" the output uses \"whom I met\" to refer back to the lawyer. So maybe the instruction was to convert \"I met\" into \"whom I met\" in cases where \"I\" is the subject of the clause. But that's only in the second example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to add more specificity, like expanding \"lawyer I met\" into \"the lawyer whom I met.\" But that seems context-dependent.\n\nLooking at the first output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" So the input was thanking for help, output is a more formal version. So perhaps the instruction was to replace \"thank you\" with a more elaborate expression of gratitude, like expanding the reason or using formal language.\n\nSimilarly, the third output: \"Various approaches were considered\" expands \"I considered\" into a more general statement. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase \"I did X\" into \"X were/were X\" with more descriptive terms.\n\nFourth input/output is turning a casual greeting into a formal reply.\n\nFifth input/output is replacing slang with a more positive adjective.\n\nIf we consider all these possibilities, the instruction might be a combination of tasks: rephrase the input into a more formal register, expand the sentence with additional descriptors, convert active to passive voice in some cases, and replace informal expressions with more standard phrasing. However, this seems too vague to capture all outputs.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to respond with a counterexample or transformation that fits a particular rule, but given the diverse outputs, that's unlikely.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, there's a common element of adding more words or expanding the sentence. For example:\n\n- \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" adds \"is much appreciated\"\n- \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" adds \"whom I met yesterday\"\n- \"Various approaches were considered.\" replaces \"I considered\" with \"were considered\"\n- \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" adds \"I look forward to...\"\n- \"This song is incredibly good.\" replaces \"is fire\" with \"is incredibly good\"\n\nMaybe the instruction was to generate a list of possible rephrasings or expansions for each input, selecting one that best meets the criteria. But the problem states that the friend gave outputs for every input, so each output must be derived from the instruction through some consistent rule.\n\nAnother approach: check if all outputs follow the same transformation type.\n\nFirst output: expands \"help\" to \"assistance\" and adds \"is much appreciated.\"\n\nSecond output: adds \"whom\" to \"I met\" and keeps the rest.\n\nThird output: changes subject to \"Various approaches\" and uses passive voice.\n\nFourth output: changes \"See you...\" to \"I look forward to...\" (active to active, but more formal).\n\nFifth output: replaces \"fire\" with \"incredibly good.\"\n\nNo obvious pattern here. Let's think of possible instruction types:\n\n1. **Formalization**: Make the language more formal.\n2. **Expansion**: Add more words or phrases to make the statement more detailed.\n3. **Passive Voice Conversion**: Turn active sentences into passive.\n4. **Rephrasing Greetings**: Turn casual greetings into more formal replies.\n5. **Positive Reinforcement**: Replace negative or informal expressions with positives.\n\nBut the second example doesn't fit formalization (adds \"whom\"), third doesn't fit passive (subject changes to plural), fifth doesn't fit greeting (input was a song review).\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to replace each input with its opposite or a variation, but that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let's think of each input-output pair as examples of possible transformations. The friend might have been asked to apply a set of rules or choose between possible transformations. However, since the user provided all the outputs for the given instructions, the instruction likely required applying a specific transformation that results in each output.\n\nFor example, if the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"you\" in certain contexts, but the outputs don't consistently do that. The first output starts with \"Your,\" the fourth has \"I,\" the fifth has \"you.\" So inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to convert the first-person singular into the third person plural. Let's see:\n\nInput 1: \"I\" becomes \"Your assistance\" – no, not third person.\n\nInput 2: \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\" – not third person.\n\nInput 3: \"I considered\" becomes \"Various approaches\" – third person plural.\n\nInput 4: \"I look forward...\" – remains first person.\n\nInput 5: \"I\" → \"you\" – no.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAnother angle: the outputs seem to often start with \"Your\" or \"I\". Let's see:\n\nFirst output: \"Your assistance...\"\nSecond output: \"The lawyer whom...\"\nThird output: \"Various approaches...\"\nFourth output: \"I look forward...\"\nFifth output: \"This song...\"\n\nSo the outputs start with different elements. But if the instruction was to start each response with \"Your\" or \"I\",",

The user provided five input-output pairs where each input has been transformed into an output by a friend. My job is to deduce the general instruction that would apply to all these examples.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each pair and see if there's a common pattern or transformation applied. Let's start with the first example:\n\nInput: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\"  \nOutput: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n\nHmm, so here the friend took the negative (\"can't tell\") and rephrased it using a synonym (\"find it hard to distinguish\"). Both phrases have similar meanings but use different verbs. The structure of the sentence is slightly changed. The input uses \"difference,\" which becomes \"distinguish\" in the output. \n\nLooking at the second pair:  \nInput: \"This song is fire.\"  \nOutput: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\n\nHere, the friend replaced the informal slang term \"fire\" with a more formal alternative. So, \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\". The structure of the sentence remains mostly the same, just the adjective is replaced with a longer phrase.\n\nThird input:  \nInput: \"Thanks for your help.\"  \nOutput: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n\nIn this case, the friend expanded the short expression into a more elaborate sentence. \"Help\" becomes \"assistance\", and \"thanks\" is rephrased as \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" So this might be about expanding abbreviations or common expressions into longer, more formal or descriptive statements.\n\nFourth input:  \nInput: \"I got what you said.\"  \nOutput: \"I understood you.\"\n\nAgain, a rephrasing from informal to more direct. \"Got what you said\" is simplified to \"understood you.\" The verb form changes from past tense (\"got\") to present (\"understood\"), and the subject-verb structure shifts from \"I got\" to \"I understood\". \n\nFifth input:  \nInput: \"The whole story was made up.\"  \nOutput: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n\nHere, the friend used a synonym for \"made up\". \"Made up\" (meaning invented) translates to \"fabricated\". The structure is preserved except for the noun \"whole\" becoming \"entire\", but both refer to the totality. However, \"whole\" isn't a synonym for \"entire\" in this context; maybe that's just part of the phrase. The key change is replacing \"made up\" with \"fabricated\".\n\nNow, looking for a common thread among all these transformations. Let's categorize them:\n\n1. Rephrasing with synonyms or more formal terms. Examples: \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\"; \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\"; \"made up\" → \"fabricated\".\n2. Expanding abbreviated expressions. \"Thanks for your help\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n3. Simplifying phrasing from informal to more direct statements. \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you.\"\n4. Replacing collocations or idiomatic expressions with their equivalents. For instance, \"can't tell the difference\" is an idiom meaning not noticing a difference, and \"distinguish\" is the noun form of the verb \"to distinguish\".\n\nWait, maybe the key instruction is to translate informal or shortened expressions into more standard, formal English. But some examples don't fit that. Like the third input, expanding \"help\" into \"assistance\"—that seems like a different type of transformation. Similarly, the fourth input simplifies \"got what you said\" to \"understood you\". The first example rephrases a negative into a less direct but still positive statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to make the statement more polite or professional? Let's check:\n\n- First output: \"I find it hard to distinguish\"—maybe a more neutral way to express the same idea.\n- Third output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" is a more formal thank you compared to \"Thanks.\"\n- Fourth output: Direct answer instead of paraphrase.\n- Fifth output: Using \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up,\" which could be a more professional term.\n\nBut not all outputs seem to follow the politeness angle. For example, the first output isn't particularly more polite than the input. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more precise or accurate version, possibly using synonyms or more exact wording.\n\nAnother angle: The friend might be correcting or refining the inputs. For example, replacing informal slang (\"fire\") with a precise adjective (\"incredibly good\"). The first input uses \"can't tell the difference,\" which is rephrased to avoid a negative construction. The fourth input changes \"got what you said\" to \"understood you,\" which is a more straightforward way of expressing comprehension.\n\nWait, perhaps the main theme is converting the input into a more standardized or correct form. The outputs seem to avoid slang, colloquialisms, or informal phrasing. They use more formal words, more precise synonyms, or simpler direct statements.\n\nLet me consider possible instructions:\n\n1. Convert informal expressions into more formal ones.\n2. Replace abbreviations or shorthand with full phrases.\n3. Rephrase to avoid negative constructions or improve clarity.\n4. Use synonyms to replace certain words or phrases.\n5. Transform direct statements into more indirect or polite expressions.\n\nLooking across all inputs, most outputs seem to do one of the following:\n- Replace informal language with more formal or precise terms (e.g., \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\").\n- Expand abbreviations/shortened expressions (e.g., \"Thanks\" → \"Your assistance...\").\n- Rephrase negative constructions into more neutral or direct statements (e.g., \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\").\n- Use synonyms to restate the input (e.g., \"made up\" → \"fabricated\").\n\nA possible instruction could be: \"Rewrite each input into a more precise or accurate version, avoiding informal or overly casual language, and replacing slang or collocations with their more standard equivalents.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to translate the inputs into a more formal register, or to rephrase them in a way that maintains the original meaning but uses different wording.\n\nTesting this hypothesis against the examples:\n\n- Input 1: \"can't tell the difference\" → Output uses \"find it hard to distinguish\". This avoids the negative construction (can't vs. can). It's more neutral and formal.\n- Input 2: \"This song is fire\" → Output uses \"incredibly good\". This replaces slang with a precise adjective.\n- Input 3: \"Thanks\" → Output expands it into a more elaborate sentence, making it more formal.\n- Input 4: \"I got what you said\" → Output simplifies to \"I understood you\", removing any indirectness.\n- Input 5: \"made up\" → \"fabricated\", replacing an informal phrasing with a precise synonym.\n\nSo the instruction likely involves transforming the input into a more accurate, precise, or standard form of expression, possibly avoiding slang, colloquialisms, or overly indirect phrasing. The outputs seem to aim for clarity, formality, or correctness over creativity or style.\n\nAnother thought: The outputs are often shorter than the inputs. For example, \"The whole story...\" becomes \"The entire story...\", but \"whole\" is replaced with \"entire\". However, that doesn't seem to shorten the length much. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase rather than condense or expand.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a version that sounds more natural or less stilted, perhaps even correcting grammar or word choice. For example, \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\" might be better phrasing, assuming the input was considered informal or too brief.\n\nGiven that all the outputs seem to replace certain words or phrases with alternatives that are more standard or precise, the instruction is probably something like: \"Convert each input into a more accurate and precise statement by replacing informal terms, slang, or collocations with their correct equivalents.\"\n\nTo confirm, let's check another example. If the input were \"He's a real player,\" the output might be \"He is very attractive\" or \"He is a skilled debater\"—replacing slang with more precise descriptions.\n\nYes, this seems to fit all the given examples. Therefore, the instruction was likely to rephrase each input into a more standard, precise, or accurate version, replacing informal or less precise language with more exact equivalents.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **convert each input into a more precise and accurate statement** by rephrasing informal or colloquial expressions into standard English. This involved replacing slang, abbreviations, and less exact phrasing with synonyms or more formal equivalents while maintaining the core meaning. \n\n### Example Breakdown:\n1. **Input:** \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\"  \n   **Output:** \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"  \n   *Negative phrasing (\"can't tell\") was rephrased for neutrality.*\n\n2. **Input:** \"This song is fire.\"  \n   **Output:** \"This song is incredibly good.\"  \n   *Slang (\"fire\") was replaced with a precise descriptor.*\n\n3. **Input:** \"Thanks for your help.\"  \n   **Output:** \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"  \n   *Abbreviated gratitude was expanded into a more formal statement.*\n\n4. **Input:** \"I got what you said.\"  \n   **Output:** \"I understood you.\"  \n   *Indirect phrasing was simplified for clarity.*\n\n5. **Input:** \"The whole story was made up.\"  \n   **Output:** \"The entire story was fabricated.\"  \n   *Colloquialism (\"made up\") was replaced with a synonym.*\n\n### General Instruction:\n\"Refine each input into a clearer, more precise version by substituting informal terms, slang, or ambiguous expressions with their exact or standard counterparts.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

    "instruction_outputs": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nI gave a friend an instruction and five inputs.

The user provided five input-output pairs, and they want to know what the original instruction was. Hmm, I need to figure out the pattern or rule that transforms each input into its corresponding output.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to get a clear view.\n\nInput 1: The whole story was made up.  \nOutput 1: The entire story was fabricated.\n\nInput 2: I considered many approaches.  \nOutput 2: Various approaches were considered.\n\nWait, looking at these first two examples, the outputs seem almost identical to the inputs. Let me check. The first input is \"The whole story was made up.\" Output is \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Wait, the output actually changed some words. So maybe not a direct synonym replacement? Because \"whole\" vs \"entire\" are synonyms, but \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated.\" Hmm. Let me parse the rest.\n\nThird input: Thanks for your help.  \nOutput: Your assistance is much appreciated.  \nSo here, the output is more polite and perhaps rephrased with \"much appreciated\" instead of \"help\" as in \"assistance\". But \"Your assistance...\" could also mean \"the help you gave,\" so maybe it's a form of making it more formal or enhancing it. Not sure yet.\n\nFourth input: The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.  \nOutput: The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.  \nAh, here the output changes \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". The original uses the subject case pronoun \"I\", which might be considered informal, while the output uses \"whom\", which is the objective case. So the instruction might be to rephrase informal language (using \"I\") into more formal English by replacing pronouns.\n\nFifth input: We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.  \nOutput: It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.  \nThis seems like a complete sentence structure change. The input is a negative statement about not thinking doing anything is a good idea. The output rephrases it as a suggestion against taking action, using \"it is suggested\" and changing the timeframe to \"at this stage\" instead of \"right now.\"\n\nLooking at the first two inputs again. The first output changed \"whole\" to \"entire\", \"was made up\" to \"was fabricated\". The second input: \"considered many approaches\" output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" So \"many approaches\" becomes \"various approaches\"—\"various\" being a synonym but perhaps used in a more formal way. Or maybe \"considered\" stays, but \"many approaches\" is replaced by \"various approaches\" which is a slightly different phrasing. But \"approaches\" is singular in the output, whereas \"many approaches\" is plural. Wait, wait: Input 2 says \"many approaches\", but the output says \"Various approaches were considered.\" Wait, \"various approaches\" is plural. But the input is \"many approaches\"—\"many\" is plural. So the output keeps \"approaches\" as plural. So maybe just a synonym substitution. But \"considered\" in the input is \"were considered\" in the output. Wait, input 2 is \"I considered many approaches.\" Output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" So the subject-verb agreement changes here. Wait, the input is singular (\"I considered\"), output is plural (\"Various approaches were considered\"). That's a shift from singular to plural. So maybe the instruction was to make the subject plural or something else?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about rephrasing common phrases. Let's see:\n\nInput 1: \"was made up\" → \"was fabricated\" – same structure, different verb.\n\nInput 2: \"I considered many approaches\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" So \"I considered\" becomes \"were considered\". The subject in the input is \"I\" (singular), but in the output, the subject is \"Various approaches\" (plural). So the instruction might require converting the subject to plural, or changing the perspective from first person to third person, or perhaps removing the subject altogether.\n\nWait, let's look at Input 3. Original: \"Thanks for your help.\" Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" So \"Thanks for your help\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Here, the input is an expression of gratitude, and the output is a more formal acknowledgment, phrased as \"Your assistance is...\". So maybe the instruction is to rephrase expressions of gratitude into more formal or official language, using \"Your assistance\" instead of \"Thanks for your help\".\n\nNow Input 4: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, the change is replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met\". So \"met\" (past tense) becomes \"whom met\". Wait, but in the output, it's \"whom I met\", which is still correct but using the object case. So the instruction could be to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" when referring to oneself as the object of a preposition. Because in the original, \"I met\" is the subject, but if the original had said \"The person I met...\", then replacing \"I\" with \"who\" would be correct. Wait, but here the output uses \"whom\". So maybe the rule is that whenever there's a prepositional phrase referring back to the speaker, use \"whom\" instead of \"I\". For example, \"I met the lawyer\" becomes \"The lawyer whom I met\".\n\nLooking at Input 5: Original is a negative statement: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" So this seems like a rephrasing to make it more passive and formal, using \"is suggested\" instead of \"don't think\", and changing the timing from \"right now\" to \"at this stage\".\n\nPutting all this together, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or standard English version. Let's check if all examples fit this.\n\nFor example:\n\nInput 1: The whole story was made up.  \nOutput: The entire story was fabricated.  \nBoth are formal. No personal pronouns, no contractions. So that fits.\n\nInput 2: I considered many approaches.  \nOutput: Various approaches were considered.  \nLess personal, uses plural noun instead of \"many\", and shifts to passive voice? Wait, input is active (\"I considered\"), output is passive (\"were considered\"). But the subject changes from \"I\" to \"approaches\". So the original is active, output is passive. So maybe the instruction was to convert active sentences to passive voice.\n\nWait, let's test that hypothesis.\n\nInput 2: Active voice: \"I considered...\" → Passive: \"were considered\" by changing the subject to the object. So the original subject \"I\" becomes the object \"approaches\", hence passive voice. So the instruction might involve converting active voice to passive voice.\n\nBut let's check other examples. For example, Input 4: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So here, instead of changing voice, they changed the pronoun from \"I\" to \"whom\". If the input had been \"The person I met...\", the output would be \"The person whom I met...\". So maybe the rule is to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" when it follows a preposition like \"met\".\n\nAnother possibility is that the instruction was to formalize the language, removing contractions and informal terms. For example, \"don't think\" becomes \"is suggested\", \"helpful\" (adjective) becomes \"was helpful\" (passive). Wait, not sure.\n\nLet's go back to the initial examples:\n\nInput 1: The whole story was made up.  \nOutput: The entire story was fabricated.  \nSo \"whole\" → \"entire\", \"made up\" → \"fabricated\". Same structure, just synonyms. Maybe replacing some common phrases.\n\nInput 2: I considered many approaches.  \nOutput: Various approaches were considered.  \n\"Many approaches\" → \"various approaches\" (synonyms). \"Considered\" stays, but the subject changes from \"I\" to \"approaches\" in plural. So passive voice?\n\nInput 3: Thanks for your help.  \nOutput: Your assistance is much appreciated.  \nFormalizing the gratitude. Instead of thanking directly, rephrasing to a more formal acknowledgment.\n\nInput 4: The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.  \nOutput: The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.  \nChanging \"I met\" to \"whom I met\", which is a more formal usage of the pronoun.\n\nInput 5: We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.  \nOutput: It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.  \nRewriting the negative opinion as a suggestion, using more formal language.\n\nSo putting all these together, the instruction might be to transform the input into a more formal, passive-voice version, replacing pronouns like \"I\" with their objective cases (\"whom\"), and rephrasing expressions into more formal or standard English.\n\nAnother angle: Let's see the differences between the inputs and outputs:\n\nIn Input 1 and Output 1: \"whole\" to \"entire\", \"made up\" to \"fabricated\". So perhaps replacing informal terms with more formal ones.\n\nInput 2: \"considered many approaches\" becomes \"various approaches were considered.\" Here, \"many approaches\" becomes \"various approaches\" (synonym), and the structure changes to passive voice. So \"I considered\" becomes \"were considered\", shifting the subject from \"I\" to \"approaches\". So passive voice conversion.\n\nInput 3: Formalizing \"Thanks for your help\" into \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" So changing the expression of thanks to a more formal statement about the assistance.\n\nInput 4: Changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". This is replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" when it follows a preposition (met). So the rule could be: when the subject is followed by \"met\", \"ate\", etc., and refers to the speaker, replace \"I\" with \"whom\".\n\nInput 5: Rewriting the sentence as a suggestion rather than a negative opinion, using passive voice and more formal language.\n\nSo combining all these observations, the instruction might have multiple components:\n\n1. Convert active voice to passive voice where applicable.\n2. Replace informal pronouns (\"I\") with their objective forms (\"whom\") when following certain verbs (like \"met\").\n3. Formalize expressions (e.g., \"thanks for your help\" becomes \"your assistance is much appreciated\").\n4. Replace informal expressions with more formal equivalents (e.g., \"made up\" → \"fabricated\", \"don't think\" → \"is suggested\").\n\nAdditionally, checking for other possible patterns:\n\nIn Input 2, \"many approaches\" becomes \"various approaches\". \"Many\" and \"various\" are synonyms, but \"various\" is a bit more formal. Also, \"considered\" in the input becomes \"were considered\" in the output, shifting the subject to the noun \"approaches\".\n\nFor Input 4, changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". So perhaps any occurrence of \"I\" followed by a past participle (like \"met\") should be replaced with \"whom\".\n\nAnother example: If the input was \"He saw the movie yesterday\", output would be \"The movie was seen by him yesterday\"? Not sure. But the given example only has \"I met\".\n\nSo maybe the rule is: when \"I\" is followed by a past tense verb (like \"met\"), replace \"I\" with \"whom\" to make it formal.\n\nAlso, in Input 5, \"right now\" becomes \"at this stage\", which is a shift from present time to future/present continuous.\n\nPutting all this together, the instruction likely required transforming each input into a more formal version by applying several rules:\n\n- Passive voice conversion where appropriate.\n- Replacement of \"I\" with \"whom\" after certain verbs.\n- Formalizing gratitude expressions.\n- Replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents.\n- Changing time references from present (right now) to more formal terms (at this stage).\n\nBut how to phrase this as a single instruction? Maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal, professional style by adhering to grammar rules like subject-verb agreement, using proper pronoun cases, converting to passive voice where applicable, and substituting formal vocabulary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to convert the input into a more elegant version by making it passive, replacing \"I\" with \"whom\", formalizing gratitude, and adjusting time references.\n\nTo confirm, let's check if all input-output pairs align with this hypothetical instruction.\n\nInput 1: Active → passive? \"The whole story was made up\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" The voice didn't change; just the noun. So maybe not passive. Then maybe \"whole\" → \"entire\" is a synonym replacement, and \"made up\" → \"fabricated\" as well. So perhaps replacing some common collocations with their formal equivalents.\n\nInput 2: Active \"I considered\" → passive \"were considered\". Subject changes to \"approaches\", so yes, passive voice conversion. Also, \"many approaches\" → \"various approaches\", which are synonyms.\n\nInput 3: \"Thanks for your help\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Formalizing the expression.\n\nInput 4: \"I met\" → \"whom I met\". Using \"whom\" for formal tone.\n\nInput 5: \"We don't think...\" → \"It is suggested...\". Converting a negative opinion to a positive suggestion, using passive voice and more formal language.\n\nSo combining all these transformations, the instruction seems to be to convert the input into a more formal and professional version, possibly including passive voice, adjusting pronoun cases, rephrasing gratitude, and altering time references.\n\nAnother angle: The first three outputs show no obvious grammatical structure changes except in the fourth input. The fourth input's output is a change in pronoun case from \"I\" to \"whom\". The fifth input's output involves a complete restructuring into a suggestion rather than a negative statement.\n\nGiven all these varied changes, perhaps the most comprehensive instruction would be to \"rephrase the input into a more formal, professional tone, incorporating elements such as passive voice, proper pronoun usage (especially 'whom'), polite expressions for gratitude, and adjustments to time expressions.\"\n\nAlternatively, since the fourth input's transformation is about pronoun case, and others are about voice and formalization, maybe the instruction was specifically to convert \"I\" to \"whom\" where appropriate, use passive voice, formalize gratitude, and adjust time references.\n\nBut without seeing the exact instruction, we have to deduce based on the examples. The key is that each output is a more formal version of the input, applying various linguistic rules to make it more standard or academic.\n\nThus, the instruction was likely: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal and professional English version by converting to passive voice where applicable, using appropriate pronoun cases (especially replacing 'I' with 'whom'), formalizing expressions of gratitude, and adjusting temporal expressions to a more formal tone.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal and professional English version**, applying the following transformations:\n\n1. **Passive Voice Conversion**: Where applicable, convert active sentences to passive voice.  \n   - Example: *\"I considered many approaches.\"* → *\"Various approaches were considered.\"*\n\n2. **Proper Pronoun Usage**: Replace informal \"I\" with the objective case \"whom\" when following certain verbs (e.g., *met*, *ate*).  \n   - Example: *\"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"* → *\"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"*\n\n3. **Polite Formalization**: Rewrite expressions of gratitude or thanks into more formal acknowledgments.  \n   - Example: *\"Thanks for your help.\"* → *\"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"*\n\n4. **Temporal Adjustments**: Update informal time references (e.g., \"right now\") to more formal terms (e.g., \"at this stage\").  \n   - Example: *\"We don’t think it’s a good idea to do anything right now.\"* → *\"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"*\n\n5. **Vocabulary Refinement**: Substitute informal or colloquial terms with their formal counterparts (e.g., \"made up\" → \"fabricated\").  \n\nBy systematically applying these rules, each input was transformed into a more standardized, formal, and polite version of the original statement.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The friend was given five input-output pairs and had to apply some kind of transformation or rule to generate each output from the input. My job is to reverse-engineer that instruction based on these examples.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each pair and see what changes were made. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nOutput: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nWait, here the input had \"I met,\" but the output changed it to \"whom I met.\" So \"I\" became \"whom.\" But why? Maybe the instruction involves changing possessive pronouns into their object forms when certain conditions are met. But why \"whom\" instead of \"who\"? Because \"I\" is the subject, so maybe when it's in a dependent clause (like after \"whom\"), it becomes \"whom.\" Hmm, but that's just for this case.\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: \"I can't stand his temper.\"\nOutput: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\nSo here, \"can't stand\" became \"cannot tolerate.\" Not sure why. Maybe it's replacing specific phrases with others. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction involves changing the verb phrase from \"can't stand X\" to \"cannot tolerate X.\" But \"can't stand\" and \"cannot tolerate\" are both negative expressions, but the outputs are more formal maybe?\n\nThird example:\nInput: \"Thanks for your help.\"\nOutput: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\nAh, here a direct thanks is converted into a more elaborate expression of gratitude. This could be part of the instruction—maybe replacing gratitude expressions with more formal ones. But not all outputs seem like that. For example, the third output is a bit more formal, but others might not follow the same structure.\n\nFourth input-output:\nInput: \"Please call once you get there.\"\nOutput: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\nSo here, \"once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival.\" That's a phrasing change, probably to use a more formal or specific prepositional phrase. So replacing \"once\" with \"upon\" and restructuring the clause.\n\nFifth input-output:\nInput: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\"\nOutput: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\nThis is a significant change. The original is a negative statement (\"we don't think...\") transformed into a suggestion (\"it is suggested...\"). The structure here is completely different. So maybe the instruction involves rephrasing negative statements into positive suggestions or recommendations.\n\nNow, compiling all these observations. Let's list possible instruction components:\n\n1. Handling possessive pronouns in a specific context (e.g., turning \"I met\" into \"whom I met\").\n2. Replacing certain verb phrases (like \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\").\n3. Rewriting expressions of gratitude into more formal alternatives.\n4. Changing clauses with \"once you get there\" into phrases like \"upon your arrival\".\n5. Converting negative thoughts or suggestions into positive recommendations or advice.\n\nBut wait, looking at the fifth example, the input was a negative opinion (\"don't think it's a good idea\"), and the output is a positive suggestion. So maybe the instruction is to take any negative statement and rephrase it as a positive recommendation.\n\nBut how does that fit with the other examples? Let's see:\n\nFirst input-output: \"I met\" → \"whom I met\". Maybe that's part of converting \"I\" into \"whom\" when it's in a relative clause after a noun, like \"the lawyer whom I met\". So perhaps the instruction is related to relative clauses.\n\nThird output: \"Thanks...\" becomes \"Your assistance...\". Maybe replacing thank-yous with more formal expressions, but that's not universal because the fourth input is a different structure.\n\nSecond output: \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\". Not sure about that.\n\nFourth: \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\". That seems to be replacing a temporal clause with a prepositional phrase.\n\nFifth: Negative statement → positive suggestion.\n\nHmm. There's a mix here. Maybe the instruction is a combination of different transformations. Let's think of possible instruction types:\n\n- **Grammatical correction**: Like changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" in relative clauses. But the third example uses \"your\" in the output, which wasn't present in the input. So that's not purely grammatical.\n\n- **Rephrasing common phrases**: For example, replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\", but only in cases where it's preceded by \"his\". Not sure.\n\n- **Formalizing language**: Changing casual phrases into more formal ones. For instance, \"Thanks for your help\" to \"Your assistance...\", \"Please call once you get there\" to \"Please call upon your arrival\", and the fifth example rephrasing a negative into a suggestion.\n\nBut why are some outputs more about grammar (like the first example) and others about phrasing and content (like the third, fourth, fifth)?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert informal or first-person statements into more formal third-person passive voice or recommendations. Let's check:\n\nFirst example: Input is in first person (\"I met\"), output uses \"whom I met\" (still first person). Doesn't seem to be passive.\n\nThird example: Output is \"Your assistance...\", which is more formal and uses \"your\" instead of \"his\". So maybe replacing second-person plural (\"your\") with singular and using \"assistance\" instead of \"help\". But that's inconsistent with the third input being \"your help\" and the output being \"Your assistance...\".\n\nFourth example: Changing \"once you get there\" into \"upon your arrival\". Both are temporal phrases, but \"arrival\" is more formal.\n\nFifth example: The instruction seems to invert the perspective from \"We don't think...\" to a suggestion addressed to the reader. So maybe it's taking a negative opinion and turning it into a positive recommendation for the reader to take action.\n\nPutting all this together, perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal and polite version, possibly converting negatives into positive recommendations, and adjusting pronouns and phrases accordingly.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis against all examples:\n\n1. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"  \n   Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"  \n   Here, the output uses \"whom\" instead of \"I\", which might be due to a relative clause rule. Alternatively, changing the possessive form. Wait, the original has \"my\" but the output has \"whom\". Hmm, maybe the instruction was to replace \"I met\" with \"whom I met\" in relative clauses. But why? Unless the instruction is about making the sentence more formal, using \"whom\" instead of \"who\" when referring to the subject. But the output still uses \"I met\" but with \"whom\". Wait, the input is \"I met\", and the output is \"whom I met\". So maybe it's changing the pronoun from subject to object form in a specific context.\n\n   Another possibility: the instruction is to add a relative clause after the subject, like inserting \"whom\" as the object of a clause. But why would the original input not have a relative clause? The original is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output adds \"whom I met yesterday\". So perhaps the instruction was to add a relative clause starting with \"whom\" after the noun \"lawyer\", replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met\". That could explain the first output.\n\n2. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\"  \n   Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"  \n   Here, the verb phrase \"can't stand\" is replaced with \"cannot tolerate\". The negation stays the same, but the verb changes. Maybe the instruction is to replace specific negative expressions with others. For example, \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\".\n\n3. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\"  \n   Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"  \n   This seems to turn a direct gratitude into a more formal and lengthy expression. Maybe the instruction is to replace \"Thanks for...\" with \"Your assistance... is much appreciated.\"\n\n4. Input: \"Please call once you get there.\"  \n   Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"  \n   Here, \"once you get there\" is replaced with \"upon your arrival\". Both mean the same thing, but the latter is more formal. So the instruction might involve replacing informal temporal clauses with more formal prepositional phrases.\n\n5. Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\"  \n   Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"  \n   The original negative statement is transformed into a positive suggestion. The structure changes entirely, moving from a first-person opinion to a third-person suggestion addressed to the reader. So the instruction might involve converting negative statements into positive recommendations.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction likely involves multiple transformations:\n\n- Adjusting pronoun usage (like changing \"I\" to \"whom\" in certain contexts).\n- Replacing informal verb phrases with more formal ones (e.g., \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\").\n- Formalizing language (e.g., changing \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival\").\n- Rewriting gratitude expressions into more formal alternatives.\n- Transforming negative statements into positive recommendations.\n\nBut to find a single instruction that encompasses all these, perhaps the most general one is: **\"Convert the input into a more formal and polite version, adjusting pronouns, verb phrases, and sentence structures as needed, and rephrase negative statements into positive recommendations.\"**\n\nHowever, checking if the examples align with this. For instance, the first output uses \"whom\" instead of \"I\"—if the instruction is to formalize, then using \"whom\" would be part of that. The third example turns \"Thanks\" into a more elaborate phrase, which is polite. The fourth example replaces \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\", which is more formal. The fifth example turns a negative into a positive suggestion. So yes, all these transformations fit under formalizing and politeness.\n\nBut maybe the instruction is even more specific. For example, focusing on rephrasing gratitude into appreciation, adjusting pronouns, and changing certain verbs. Alternatively, the instruction could be: \"Replace 'can't stand' with 'cannot tolerate', adjust possessives to formal language (like 'your' → 'assistance'), insert relative clauses after nouns with 'whom', and rephrase temporal clauses to use 'upon your arrival' or similar.\"\n\nBut the key is that the instruction must cover all the given examples. Let's see if a single instruction can cover them.\n\nAlternative possibilities:\n\n- **The instruction could be to convert first-person narratives into third-person passive recommendations.** For example, the first input is turned into \"The lawyer whom [I] met yesterday was helpful.\" Wait, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe the instruction is to change the perspective from first to third person. But the first output is still in first person except for \"whom\".\n\nAnother angle: the fifth output is a complete rephrasing into a suggestion. Perhaps the instruction was to take any negative statement and turn it into a positive recommendation for action. For example, \"We don't think...\" → \"It is recommended that...\".\n\nLooking at the first example again, it's not a negative statement, but the output uses \"was helpful\", which is a positive attribute. Maybe the instruction is to turn any statement into a positive one. But the second example is not negative. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to make the language more formal and polite, which could include various transformations. For instance:\n\n- Replace contractions with full forms (like \"can't\" → \"cannot\").\n- Use more formal pronouns or terms (e.g., \"you\" → \"your\", \"I\" → \"me\" depending on context).\n- Adjust sentence structures for clarity and formality.\n- Insert polite phrasing for requests (e.g., \"please call\" remains, but the timing is adjusted).\n\nBut the second example's contraction \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\" suggests changing the verb phrase. Maybe the instruction is to replace specific verbs or phrases with their formal counterparts.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to translate the input into a more formal register while making it more polite. This would cover changing contractions, using more formal pronouns, adjusting sentence structure, and rephrasing gratitude and recommendations.\n\nGiven all the examples, the most comprehensive instruction that fits all cases is:\n\n**\"Your task is to transform the input into a more formal and polite version by adjusting pronouns, replacing contractions with full forms, modifying verb phrases, restructuring sentences for clarity, and converting gratitude expressions into more elaborate acknowledgments. Additionally, rephrase negative statements into positive recommendations for action.\"**\n\nBut the question is whether this accurately encapsulates all the given examples. Let's verify:\n\n1. \"I met\" → \"whom I met\": This could be part of restructuring the sentence for formality, using \"whom\" as the object of a clause. Alternatively, inserting a relative clause starting with \"whom\" after \"lawyer\".\n\n2. \"I can't stand\" → \"I cannot tolerate\": This is changing the contraction to the full form, which is part of making it more formal.\n\n3. \"Thanks for your help\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated\": This is an elaboration, which is a form of politeness and formality.\n\n4. \"Please call once you get there\" → \"Please call upon your arrival\": Changing the temporal clause to a more formal prepositional phrase.\n\n5. \"We don't think...\" → \"It is suggested...\": Converting a negative opinion into a positive recommendation, which is a form of making it more polite (by shifting the focus to action rather than negation).\n\nThus, combining all these, the instruction is likely focused on formalizing language, making it more polite, adjusting pronouns and phrases, and restructuring sentences. However, another possible instruction could be more specific. For example, focusing on rephrasing gratitude and negative statements into recommendations, along with adjusting pronouns and contractions. But given the examples, the most inclusive instruction would mention adjusting pronouns, verb phrases, sentence structures, and rephrasing gratitude and negatives into recommendations. \n\nAnother possibility: The instruction could be to replace specific phrases or structures, such as \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\", \"your help\" → \"your assistance\", \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\", and negative statements into positive suggestions. This would require the friend to recognize these patterns and apply them systematically.\n\nBut since the examples vary widely, it's challenging to pinpoint a single instruction without more context. However, given the outputs, the most plausible instruction is to convert the input into a more formal and polite version, adjusting pronouns, verb phrases, and sentence structures as necessary, particularly by rephrasing negatives into recommendations and using more formal prepositions and terms like \"whom\" in relative clauses.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the outputs include phrases like \"it is suggested that\", which introduces a recommendation, the instruction might specifically ask to turn any negative statement into a positive suggestion for action. However, the first four examples don't fit that, so that's less likely.\n\nAfter thorough analysis, I think the instruction was to \"Convert the input into a more formal and polite version, adjusting pronouns, verb phrases, and sentence structures as needed, and rephrase negative statements into positive recommendations.\" This covers all examples:\n\n- First input-output involves adjusting \"I met\" to \"whom I met\", which is part of making it more formal (using \"whom\" instead of \"I\" might be part of adjusting pronouns).\n- Second example converts \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\", which is adjusting verb phrases.\n- Third example transforms a gratitude into a more elaborate acknowledgment.\n- Fourth example changes the temporal clause to a more formal preposition.\n- Fifth example rephrases a negative into a positive recommendation.\n\nYes, this instruction seems to fit all cases.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided required transforming the input into a **more formal and polite version**, involving adjustments to **pronouns, verb phrases, sentence structures, and phrasing**. Specifically, the friend was to:\n\n1. **Adjust pronouns and possessives**:\n   - Replace first-person \"I\" with formal \"whom\" in certain contexts (e.g., relative clauses).\n   - Formalize second-person references (e.g., \"your help\" → \"your assistance\").\n\n2. **Modify verb phrases**:\n   - Convert contractions (e.g., \"can't stand\") to their full forms (\"cannot tolerate\").\n   - Replace informal expressions with more formal equivalents (e.g., \"tolerate\" instead of \"stand\").\n\n3. **Restructure sentences**:\n   - Restructure temporal clauses using formal prepositions (e.g., \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\").\n   - Restructure gratitude expressions into elaborate acknowledgments (e.g., \"thanks\" → \"much appreciated\").\n\n4. **Rephrase negative statements**:\n   - Transform negative opinions into positive recommendations (e.g., \"we don't think...\" → \"it is suggested...\").\n\n**Final Instruction**:  \n\"Refine the input by formalizing language, using polite tone, adjusting pronouns and verb phrases, restructuring clauses for clarity, and converting negative statements into constructive recommendations.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

Hmm, the user provided five input-output examples, and we need to deduce the underlying rule or pattern that connects them. Let's start by analyzing each pair carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the first example:\nInput: \"She looks like her sister.\" Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\nHere, the output seems to be a synonym substitution. \"Looks like\" is being replaced with \"resembles,\" which are similar in meaning but slightly different in nuance. So maybe the instruction is to replace certain phrases with their synonyms or rephrase using more formal language.\n\nSecond example:\nInput: \"This song is fire.\" Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\nAgain, a colloquial expression (\"fire\") is converted into a more formal or descriptive phrase (\"incredibly good\"). The structure here might involve replacing slang or informal terms with standard adjectives and adverbs.\n\nThird input-output pair:\n\"She whole story was made up.\" becomes \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Here, the input uses \"whole\" instead of \"entire,\" and \"made up\" versus \"fabricated.\" It looks like converting phrases related to completeness (\"whole\" to \"entire\") and fabrication (\"made up\" to \"fabricated\").\n\nFourth input:\n\"Please call once you get there.\" Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\" The key change here is changing the adverb \"once\" (adverb) to the preposition \"upon,\" followed by a possessive adjective \"your\" and \"arrival.\" So perhaps the instruction involves transforming temporal expressions into more elevated or formal phrasing.\n\nFifth input-output:\n\"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\" This is a significant change in sentence structure. The input is a question starting with \"do you want me...\" and the output is a question starting with \"shall I...\" which uses the subjunctive mood or a more formal request. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase yes/no questions or certain types of questions into more formal alternatives, often using \"shall I\" for offers or suggestions.\n\nNow, putting these observations together. The instruction likely involves taking natural language phrases and converting them into more formal or polite equivalents. Let's check each example again:\n\n1. Formalizing informal language: \"looks like\" → \"resembles,\" \"is fire\" → \"is incredibly good,\" \"whole\" → \"entire,\" \"made up\" → \"fabricated,\" \"call once you get there\" → \"call upon your arrival.\" All these seem to replace casual, everyday expressions with more literary or formal alternatives.\n\n2. Changing question structures: The fifth example transforms a direct question into a more formal \"shall I...\" structure. Similarly, maybe other questions (like requests) are being converted into more polite forms. However, not all outputs are questions; some are statements.\n\nBut looking at the first four outputs, they are all statements. Only the fifth is a question. So perhaps the instruction is about making the input more formal or polite, regardless of the part of speech. For example, using \"resembles\" instead of \"looks like\" for similarity, replacing slang with more standard phrasing, converting incomplete clauses into more complete or proper expressions.\n\nAnother angle: checking for possible translations. But none of the examples seem to be translations. They are more about synonym substitution and formality.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert the input into a more poetic or descriptive form? For instance, \"fire\" to \"incredibly good\" adds a sense of praise. But \"fire\" is already positive, so maybe enhancing it.\n\nWait, the first example's output uses \"resembles\" which is a more formal synonym. \"Fire\" becomes \"incredibly good\" — that's adding an adverb \"incredibly\" to intensify the praise. Similarly, \"made up\" (as in invented) is replaced with \"fabricated,\" which is a more legalistic term. \"Call once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival,\" which is a more traditional way of saying when to do something.\n\nPutting this all together, the most probable instruction is: \"Convert the input into a more formal or polite version by replacing informal expressions with their synonyms or more elevated phrasing.\"\n\nLet me verify with each example:\n\n1. Input informal (\"looks like\") → output more formal (\"resembles\").\n2. Input slang (\"is fire\") → output more descriptive (\"is incredibly good\").\n3. Input \"whole story\" → \"entire story\"; \"made up\" → \"fabricated.\"\n4. Temporal expression \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival.\"\n5. Question phrased as offer/direct request → \"shall I accompany you?\"\n\nYes, all examples fit a pattern where the input is colloquial, informal, or uses less formal phrasing, and the output is more formal or polite. So the instruction is likely to transform the input into a more formal or polite equivalent.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **convert the input into a more formal or polite version** by replacing informal expressions with their synonyms or elevated phrasing. Each input underwent rephrasing to enhance formality, replace slang, or adjust sentence structure for politeness. \n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe instruction was to **rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version**. Each output reflects this by substituting informal terms, slang, or casual expressions with their more elevated counterparts.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs, and we need to deduce the general rule or transformation that the friend applied to each input to get the corresponding output. \n\nFirst, I'll list out the pairs again to see if there's a pattern:\n\n1. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n2. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n3. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n4. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n5. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n\nLooking at these transformations, let's analyze each one step by step.\n\nStarting with the first pair. The input uses \"considered many approaches,\" and the output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" So here, the subject is changed from \"I\" to \"Various,\" and the verb structure is flipped to passive voice? Wait, no—the output is also active voice. Hmm, maybe it's a rephrasing. Let's parse both sentences.\n\nOriginal: Subject (I) + verb (considered) + complement (many approaches).\n\nOutput: \"Various approaches\" becomes the subject, and \"were considered\" is the passive voice. Wait, but the output is \"Various approaches were considered\"—so the subject changes from \"I\" to \"Various approaches,\" and the verb is made passive. But the input wasn't in passive voice. So maybe the instruction was to convert \"I\" to another noun phrase and make it passive? But the second input doesn't fit that. Let's check the second input.\n\nSecond input: \"I think that...\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that...\" Here, the original subject \"I\" is replaced with \"It is my opinion that\". That seems like a restructuring to express opinion more formally. Maybe the instruction is to rewrite the sentence as a statement of someone's opinion using \"it is my opinion that...\"?\n\nThird input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, the possessive \"I's\" are replaced with \"whom\". So changing the indirect object pronoun (me) to a relative pronoun (whom). That suggests replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" when it's the indirect object.\n\nFourth input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" So \"look like\" is replaced with \"resemble\". That's a synonym substitution.\n\nFifth input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" So \"can't stand\" is replaced with \"cannot tolerate\". Again, a synonym replacement, perhaps of a specific phrasal verb.\n\nSo, looking at all these transformations, there might be different instructions involved. But how do they connect? Maybe the instruction isn't a single rule but multiple possible operations. However, the problem states that the instruction was given, and the friend followed it for each input. So the instruction must be a general rule that encompasses all these transformations. Let's try to see if there's a common thread.\n\nLet me list possible candidates for the instruction:\n\n1. Replace \"I\" with \"it is my opinion that\" and change to passive voice? But the third example doesn't fit because it's about \"whom\" instead of passive. Also, the second input doesn't fit the passive voice unless \"I think...\" is turned into passive, which would be \"It is thought that...\", but the output is \"It is my opinion...\".\n\nWait, maybe the instruction is to convert the sentence into a formalized version. For example:\n\n- For the first input, \"I considered many approaches\" → \"Various approaches were considered\" – perhaps rephrasing as a neutral statement without the personal perspective. But that's speculative.\n\n- Second input: changing \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion that...\" is a way to frame a personal belief more formally.\n\nThird input: replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met\". That's a specific grammar correction where \"me\" (object pronoun) should be \"whom\" in a relative clause after a preposition. For example, \"the lawyer I met\" vs. \"the lawyer whom I met\".\n\nFourth input: replacing \"looks like\" with \"resembles\". Same with fifth: \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\". These are synonym substitutions of specific collocations.\n\nHmm. So maybe the instruction is to apply multiple transformations depending on the structure of the input. But the question says the friend followed a single instruction. Therefore, there must be a unifying principle across all these outputs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to translate the sentence into another language, but that seems unlikely since the outputs are in English and don't follow translation patterns. Let's check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about rephrasing to avoid using certain pronouns or tenses. For example, replacing \"I\" with other forms. But in the first input, \"I\" is changed to \"Various approaches\", which doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, the third input's output is replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met\". That's grammatical correction. So perhaps the instruction was to correct pronoun usage by replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" in certain contexts. But why does the second input not fit that?\n\nWait, in the second input, \"I think that this is interesting\" → \"It is my opinion that...\" — this seems unrelated to pronoun usage. Similarly, the first input's output doesn't involve pronouns either. The fourth and fifth inputs involve synonym replacement.\n\nSo maybe the instruction has multiple components. For example:\n\n- If the input contains \"I think\", replace with \"It is my opinion that\".\n\n- If the input has \"I considered\", rephrase to \"Various approaches were considered\".\n\n- If the input has \"me\" in a relative clause, replace with \"whom\".\n\n- Replace \"looks like\" with \"resembles\".\n\n- Replace \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\".\n\nBut this seems too specific and piecemeal. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction is to make the sentences more formal or passive, but the third input is grammatical correction. Alternatively, the instruction could be to use synonyms or rephrase with certain constructions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to translate the sentence into another language and then back to English, but that's not indicated here. The outputs are in English.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, some seem to be passive voice conversions (though not all). For example, the first output is passive (\"were considered\"). The third output uses \"whom\", which is related to object case. The fourth and fifth are synonym replacements.\n\nWait, maybe the instruction was to convert all instances of \"I\" to another part of speech or phrase. Let's see:\n\nFirst input: \"I considered\" → \"Various approaches were considered\". Here, \"I\" is replaced with \"Various approaches\", which is a noun phrase. The verb form changes from \"considered\" (past tense) to \"were considered\" (passive voice). But the input didn't use passive. So maybe the instruction was to convert \"I\" into an adjective or noun phrase, and then make the sentence passive?\n\nBut in the third input, the output is \"The lawyer whom I met... was helpful.\" Here, \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\", so \"I\" is replaced with \"whom\", a relative pronoun. So that's a different transformation. So perhaps the instruction varies depending on the context, but the problem states there's a single instruction. This seems contradictory.\n\nWait, maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a different form based on certain rules. Let's consider possible linguistic operations:\n\n1. Replacing \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion that\".\n2. Converting \"I considered\" to \"Various approaches were considered\" (active to passive, adding \"various\" as an adjective).\n3. Grammatical correction of \"I met\" to \"whom I met\".\n4. Synonym replacement of \"looks like\" to \"resembles\".\n5. Synonym replacement of \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\".\n\nThis is a mix of different operations. Perhaps the instruction is to perform these specific transformations when possible, but since the problem states that the instruction was a single one, maybe there's a pattern I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the entire sentence into a passive voice construction. But the third input's output doesn't fit that, as it uses \"whom\" instead of passive. The first output is passive, but the others aren't. The second input's output is not passive. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase \"I think\" as a formal opinion, \"I can't stand\" as \"cannot tolerate\", etc. Let's see:\n\n- The first output might be a general rephrasing for clarity. For example, expanding \"considered many approaches\" to \"Various approaches were considered\" – perhaps emphasizing the variety rather than \"many\", but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to use more formal language. For example, replacing contractions (but none of the inputs have contractions), or changing \"I\" to \"one's\" but that's not seen.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to correct the sentence structure in certain ways. Like replacing \"I considered\" with \"Various approaches were considered\", which could be considered a structural rephrasing. Similarly, \"I can't stand\" becomes \"I cannot tolerate\", another structural change (though replacing \"can't\" with \"cannot\" is part of that). The third input's output is a grammar correction (from \"I met\" to \"whom I met\"), and the second input's output is rephrasing \"I think\" into \"It is my opinion\".\n\nWait, so maybe the instruction is to apply different transformations depending on the type of sentence. For example:\n\n- If the sentence starts with \"I think\", rephrase to \"It is my opinion that...\".\n\n- If the subject is \"I\" followed by a verb, rephrase to \"Various approaches were considered\" (passive voice with \"various\").\n\n- If there's a possessive \"I\" in a relative clause, replace with \"whom\".\n\n- Replace \"looks like\" with \"resembles\".\n\n- Replace \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\".\n\nBut this is a mix of different rules, each applied in specific cases. However, the problem states that there's a single instruction. Therefore, I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps all the transformations are variations of replacing \"I\" with another word or phrase, but adjusted to the context. For example:\n\n- \"I considered\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered\" – maybe replacing \"I\" with an adjective phrase.\n\n- \"I think\" becomes \"It is my opinion that\" – replacing \"I\" with \"my opinion\".\n\n- \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\" – changing \"me\" to \"whom\".\n\n- \"She looks like her sister\" becomes \"resembles\" – replacing \"looks like\" with \"resemble\".\n\n- \"I can't stand\" becomes \"tolerate\" – replacing the verb phrase.\n\nBut how are these connected? Maybe the instruction is to replace \"I\" with various phrases depending on the sentence structure. But the problem says the friend followed a single instruction, so this approach might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to translate the sentences into another language and back, but the outputs don't show any non-English elements.\n\nWait, looking at the third output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\". This is a case of changing the indirect object pronoun (\"me\") to a relative pronoun (\"whom\") when it's the object of a preposition. In English, when you have a prepositional phrase that refers back to the subject of the main clause, you use the objective case (\"me\"), but sometimes it's replaced with \"whom\" for formality. For example, \"The man I saw\" vs. \"The man whom I saw\". So maybe the instruction was to replace \"me\" with \"whom\" in such cases.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- In the third input, \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\".\n\nSimilarly, in the second input, \"I think that this is interesting\" becomes \"It is my opinion that this is interesting\" – maybe rephrasing to a more formal tone, removing \"I\".\n\nIn the first input, maybe the instruction was to rephrase \"I considered\" as a passive sentence with a more neutral term like \"various\", perhaps implying a range rather than a number.\n\nThe fourth input: \"She looks like her sister\" → \"resembles\". This could be a synonym replacement for \"look like\".\n\nThe fifth input: \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" – another synonym replacement.\n\nIf these are the only two types of transformations needed, perhaps the instruction is to replace \"I\" with certain phrases when possible and to replace synonyms. However, the third input's transformation is different—it's a grammatical correction.\n\nWait, but the instruction could be a combination. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence in a more formal or passive tone, replacing \"I\" with different constructions. Let's test this hypothesis:\n\nFirst input: \"I considered many approaches\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" This could be seen as a formal restatement, replacing \"I\" with \"various approaches\" and restructuring to passive voice. But why passive? Maybe the original was active, but the output is passive. Alternatively, the instruction could be to write a paraphrase avoiding \"I\".\n\nSecond input: \"I think that this is interesting\" → \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" This seems to replace \"I think\" with a more formal phrasing, possibly for emphasis.\n\nThird input: \"I met yesterday\" becomes \"whom I met\" – here, the instruction is a grammar correction, replacing \"me\" with \"whom\".\n\nFourth and fifth: Synonyms.\n\nIf the instruction was to \"paraphrase the sentence using different words while maintaining the meaning\" – but then why the varied transformations? Maybe the instruction was more specific. Alternatively, the instruction could be to perform specific transformations depending on certain keywords.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Replace \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion that...\".\n\n- Replace \"I considered\" with \"Various approaches were considered\".\n\n- Replace \"I met\" with \"whom I met\".\n\n- Replace \"looks like\" with \"resemble\".\n\n- Replace \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\".\n\nBut again, this is a collection of separate rules. Unless there's a larger pattern connecting them.\n\nWait, perhaps the instruction was to convert each sentence into a passive voice construction, replacing \"I\" with a more formal noun or phrase. Let's see:\n\nFirst input: \"I considered\" → Passive: \"Various approaches were considered\". Here, \"considered\" is passive. \"Considered\" is past participle, and \"various\" adds an adjective. Not sure.\n\nSecond input: \"I think\" → Passive would be \"It is thought...\", but the output is \"It is my opinion...\". Doesn't fit passive.\n\nThird input: \"I met\" → Passive would be \"was met\", but the output uses \"whom I met\". So grammatical correction.\n\nFourth and fifth: Not passive. So this doesn't hold.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the instruction was to convert all instances of \"I\" to other parts of speech, but the examples don't support that. Or maybe to use \"one\" or \"someone\" instead, but the outputs don't match that.\n\nAlternatively, think about the outputs and see what's common:\n\n1. First output uses \"various\" and passive voice.\n\n2. Second uses \"it is my opinion\".\n\n3. Third uses \"whom\".\n\n4. Fourth uses \"resemble\".\n\n5. Fifth uses \"cannot tolerate\".\n\nLooking for a unifying theme: Perhaps the instruction was to make the subject more general or formal. For example:\n\n- Replace \"I\" with a more general subject (like \"various approaches\" in the first case).\n\n- For \"I think\", use a formal opinion structure.\n\n- Replace \"me\" with \"whom\" for formality.\n\n- Replace colloquial expressions with more formal or standard alternatives.\n\nBut how to connect all these. Maybe the instruction was to rewrite the sentence in a more formal style, replacing certain phrases with their formal equivalents. For example:\n\n- \"I considered\" → \"Various approaches were considered\" (passive and more formal).\n\n- \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion that\" (more formal).\n\n- \"I met\" → \"Whom I met\" (grammatical formality).\n\n- \"looks like\" → \"resembles\" (more formal adjective).\n\n- \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" (formal verb phrase).\n\nIf this is the case, then the instruction was to rephrase each sentence into a more formal tone, replacing certain phrases with their more formal counterparts. Let's verify:\n\n1. \"I considered\" becomes passive and more general: \"various approaches were considered\".\n\n2. \"I think\" becomes \"my opinion\": \"It is my opinion that\".\n\n3. \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\": formal pronoun.\n\n4. \"looks like\" → \"resembles\": more formal adjective.\n\n5. \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\": formal verb phrase.\n\nYes, this seems plausible. The instruction could be: \"Rewrite each sentence using a more formal tone, replacing informal phrases and colloquialisms with their standard or more formal equivalents.\"\n\nThis would explain all the transformations:\n\n- First input: \"considered\" becomes passive and uses \"various\" for formality.\n\n- Second: Replace \"I think\" with \"my opinion\" for formality.\n\n- Third: Replace \"I met\" with \"whom I met\" for formality (using relative pronoun).\n\n- Fourth: Replace \"look like\" with \"resemble\".\n\n- Fifth: Replace \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\".\n\nTherefore, the instruction was likely to rephrase each sentence into a more formal style, using appropriate alternatives for informal expressions, changing \"I\" to formal alternatives when applicable, and adjusting sentence structures for formality.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rewrite each sentence into a more formal style**, replacing informal phrases and colloquialisms with their standard or more formal equivalents. Specifically:\n\n1. **Replace \"I\" with formal constructs** (e.g., \"my opinion,\" \"various approaches\").\n2. **Adjust verb phrases** (e.g., \"cannot tolerate\" for \"can't stand\").\n3. **Use formal nouns and adjectives** (e.g., \"resemble\" instead of \"look like\").\n4. **Correct pronoun cases** (e.g., \"whom\" in relative clauses).\n5. **Apply passive voice where appropriate** (e.g., \"were considered\").\n\n**Example breakdown:**\n\n- **Input:** \"I considered many approaches.\"  \n  **Output:** \"Various approaches were considered.\"  \n  *Replacement:* Passive voice and rephrasing to eliminate \"I.\"  \n\n- **Input:** \"I think that this is interesting.\"  \n  **Output:** \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"  \n  *Replacement:* Formal",

The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs.\nHere are the input-output pairs:\n\nInput: I considered many approaches.\nOutput: Various approaches were considered.\n\nInput: I can't stand his temper.\nOutput: I cannot tolerate his temper.\n\nInput: I think that this is interesting.\nOutput: It is my opinion that this is interesting.\n\nInput: The whole story was made up.\nOutput: The entire story was fabricated.\n\nInput: I got what you said.\nOutput: I understood you.\n\nThe instruction was<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<|begin_of_thought|>Okay, let's see. The user provided five input-output pairs where their friend transformed each input into a specific output. The task is to figure out what the original instruction could have been. So first, I need to analyze each pair to find common patterns or transformations applied to each input to get the output.\n\nStarting with the first example: Input is \"I considered many approaches.\" Output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" Hmm, the main difference here is the subject-verb structure. The original uses \"I considered,\" while the output uses \"Various approaches were considered.\" Wait, that seems like changing the subject from first person (\"I\") to third person (\"Various approaches\"), but keeping the verb structure similar. Wait, maybe it's not exactly the same. Wait, the original has \"I considered\" (active voice), and the output is \"Various approaches were considered\" (also active, but the subject is different). Wait, the output actually changes \"many approaches\" to \"various approaches,\" which might be a synonym, but the key part is the structure.\n\nWait, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentence in a more formal or passive way? Let's check other examples. Second input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Here, \"can't stand\" is replaced with \"cannot tolerate,\" which are synonyms. The structure remains similar: \"I + verb + [object].\" So maybe replacing some collocations or verbs with synonyms but keeping the structure?\n\nThird input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" Oh, here the structure changed significantly. The original starts with \"I think\" and then a statement. The output starts with \"It is my opinion...\" which is a different way of expressing the same idea. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase statements that express opinions into more formal expressions like \"It is my opinion that...\" or similar structures.\n\nFourth input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Here, \"made up\" and \"fabricated\" are synonyms. The output uses \"entire\" instead of \"whole,\" but they are synonymous. So again, replacing words with synonyms but keeping the overall meaning.\n\nFifth input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" The structure here is different. Original is a direct quote of understanding, whereas the output is \"understood you.\" So maybe the instruction was to rephrase positive statements into more general terms or use different phrasing while maintaining the core message.\n\nLooking at these examples, there are different transformations. Let me list possible instruction types:\n\n1. Restructuring to a passive voice? Not all inputs are passive. First input becomes passive but others don't seem so.\n2. Synonym replacement: replacing certain words with synonyms (e.g., made up → fabricated).\n3. Changing subject pronoun (first to third, etc.) but in some cases, not all.\n4. Restructuring phrases: e.g., \"I think that X is Y\" → \"It is my opinion that X is Y.\"\n5. Converting direct speech into reported speech? Not sure. The fifth input's output is shorter and uses \"understood you\" instead of \"got what you said.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the inputs into a more formal tone or academic style. For example, using \"it is my opinion\" instead of \"I think,\" replacing colloquial expressions with more formal ones.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\n1. Input: Active voice, first person. Output: Third person plural, same voice. Maybe changing \"I\" to \"one\" or \"they\"? But here it's \"various approaches,\" which is plural.\nWait, the first input's subject is singular (\"I\"), but the output's subject is plural (\"approaches\"). Wait, no, \"various approaches\" is plural. So changing from singular to plural? Or maybe \"I\" is changed to \"they\" or \"people,\" but that doesn't fit here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rewrite sentences that start with \"I\" into passive voice. Let's check the first input. Original: \"I considered many approaches.\" Passive would be \"Many approaches were considered by me.\" But the output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" So the agent is omitted, but the structure is passive. However, the output doesn't include \"by me,\" just the passive voice. The original wasn't in passive voice; it's active. So maybe converting active to passive voice without adding the agent? But the output in the first case does that. Similarly, second input: \"I can't stand his temper\" → \"His temper cannot be stood.\" But the output is \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" So maybe converting \"can't stand\" to \"can't tolerate,\" which are synonyms, but not exactly passive.\n\nWait, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the original sentences using more formal or academic language. For example:\n\n- Using \"various\" instead of \"many\" (more precise).\n- Changing \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\" (formal verb).\n- Rewriting \"I think that\" into \"It is my opinion that\" (formal structure).\n- Using \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up\" (synonym, more technical).\n- Shortening \"I got what you said\" to \"I understood you\" (using \"understood\" as past tense of \"understand,\" avoiding \"got\").\n\nAnother angle: looking for common elements in all outputs. All outputs start with a form of \"it\" except the first one? Wait, first output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" Wait, no, the first output is \"Various approaches were considered\" which is passive voice. The second output is \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Third is \"It is my opinion...\", fourth is \"The entire story was fabricated,\" fifth is \"I understood you.\" So not all outputs start similarly. Hmm.\n\nWait, the instruction might have been to rephrase the input sentences into more formal English, possibly using different structures. For example, in the third example, changing from first-person opinion to a formal, neutral expression. In the second example, replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate,\" which is more formal. The fifth example shortens \"I got what you said\" to \"I understood you,\" which is more concise. The fourth example replaces \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\" The first example converts active to passive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert all instances of \"I\" to third-person references (like \"one\" or \"people\"), but in the first example, \"I\" becomes \"various approaches,\" which is plural. That doesn't fit. So perhaps another pattern.\n\nLet me look for common transformations across all inputs:\n\n1. First input: \"I considered\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" The original subject is singular, but the output uses plural. The verb remains \"considered.\" So maybe changing the subject from first person to third person plural (approaches) and rephrasing the sentence structure from active to passive.\n\nBut why passivize here? Because the agent isn't specified, so maybe converting to passive voice.\n\nSecond input: \"I can't stand his temper\" → \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" The structure remains similar (I + verb + object). The only change is replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate,\" synonyms, but also making it more formal.\n\nThird input: \"I think that...\" → \"It is my opinion that...,\" changing from first-person expression of belief to a formal structure.\n\nFourth input: \"The whole story was made up\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Synonym replacement: \"made up\" → \"fabricated,\" \"whole\" → \"entire\" (synonyms).\n\nFifth input: \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you.\" The structure changes from \"I got [what you said]\" to \"I understood you.\" This might be converting the original statement into a more direct and less wordy expression.\n\nSo possible instruction: rephrase the original statement into a more formal or academic tone, using appropriate synonyms and restructuring when necessary.\n\nAnother possible angle: looking at the outputs, the instruction might have been to convert first-person opinions into third-person observations or formal statements. For example, the third input becomes a neutral statement using \"it is my opinion,\" which might be part of the instruction. But not all outputs do this. The first output is passive, the second is a synonym, fourth is synonym, fifth is a synonym phrase.\n\nWait, the third input's output is the clearest example of a structural change, moving from \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion.\"\n\nLet me check the instructions again. The problem says the instruction was given once, and the friend applied it to each input. So the instruction is likely a single rule or set of rules applicable to all inputs.\n\nPossible instruction candidates:\n\n1. Convert first-person statements into third-person or passive voice.\n   - Example 1: \"I considered\" → \"Various approaches were considered\" (passive, third person).\n   - Example 3: \"I think that...\" → \"It is my opinion...\"\n   - But not all examples fit. Example 2 is same person, same voice. Example 4 is synonym replacement. Example 5 is different structure.\n\n2. Replace informal expressions with synonyms:\n   - Example 2: \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\"\n   - Example 4: \"made up\" → \"fabricated\"\n   - Example 5: \"got what you said\" → \"understood you\"\n\n3. Restructure sentences to avoid contractions or use more formal structure:\n   - Example 3: \"I think that...\" → \"It is my opinion...\"\n   - Example 2: \"I can't stand\" → \"I cannot tolerate\" (removes contraction)\n   - Example 5: \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\" (shorter, more direct)\n\n4. Use more precise synonyms and remove vague terms:\n   - Example 1: \"many approaches\" → \"various\"\n   - Example 4: \"whole\" → \"entire\"\n   - Example 2: \"can't stand\" → \"tolerate\" (more formal)\n   - Example 5: \"understood\" vs \"got what you said\"\n\nCombining these observations, the instruction might involve rephrasing the input sentences into a more formal or academic style, possibly using synonyms and restructuring to avoid contractions or first-person expressions. Specifically, converting \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion,\" replacing informal verb phrases with more formal ones, replacing \"made up\" with \"fabricated,\" adjusting noun phrases to more precise terms (many → various, whole → entire), and avoiding contractions (can't stand → cannot tolerate). Additionally, in some cases, changing active to passive voice, though not always.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, let's check if applying these transformations to a new input would produce the corresponding output. For example, take an input like \"He is very smart.\" An instruction to rephrase formally might lead to \"It is widely recognized that he possesses a high degree of intelligence.\" But the outputs provided don't always go that far, so maybe the instruction is more specific.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs:\n\n1. Changed \"I considered\" to passive voice and pluralized.\n2. Replaced \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate.\"\n3. Expressed opinion as \"It is my opinion...\"\n4. Replaced \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\"\n5. Replaced \"got what you said\" with \"understood you.\"\n\nThis suggests multiple transformation types: passive voice conversion, synonym substitution, structural rephrasing (opinion to neutral statement), and conciseness.\n\nBut the key might be that the instruction required converting all such first-person thoughts into formal, third-person statements. However, the third example isn't about \"I\" but the original had \"I think.\" So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase any statements expressing personal opinions into neutral, formal expressions like \"it is my opinion that...\" or similar.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction was to convert all statements into third-person perspective. But in example 1, the input was \"I considered,\" and the output is \"various approaches were considered.\" So changing from first person to third person plural. But why plural? If the input is singular, output is plural, which might not make sense. Unless the instruction was to make the subject plural when possible, but that's inconsistent with the first example.\n\nAnother angle: looking at all outputs, the only thing they have in common is that they start with a form of \"I\" being removed. In example 3, \"I think\" becomes \"It is my opinion.\" In example 2, \"I can't stand\" becomes \"I cannot tolerate,\" removing \"can't.\" In example 5, \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you.\" So perhaps the instruction was to remove all instances of \"I\" and replace them with more formal alternatives. But in example 3, the output doesn't remove \"I,\" but replaces \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion.\" Alternatively, the instruction was to rephrase \"I think\" into \"It is my opinion,\" and similarly for other phrases.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction was to rephrase the inputs into third-person forms. But example 1's input is singular (\"I considered\"), output is plural (\"various approaches\"), which doesn't align. So that's not it.\n\nWait, the third input's output is \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" So here, \"I think that...\" is transformed into a neutral statement using \"it is my opinion.\" So maybe the instruction was to replace any expression of personal opinion (\"I think\", \"in my opinion\") with \"It is my opinion that...\" or similar.\n\nLooking at other examples:\n\n- Example 2: \"I can't stand his temper\" → \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" So replaced \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate,\" which are synonyms but more formal.\n\n- Example 4: \"made up\" → \"fabricated.\"\n\n- Example 5: \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you.\"\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to rephrase all such informal or first-person expressions into more formal or third-person equivalents.\n\nAnother observation: the outputs often end with a period, but the inputs don't necessarily, though none of the outputs have punctuation that isn't present in the inputs. Wait, inputs have periods unless specified otherwise, so outputs preserve the original punctuation.\n\nNow, considering all possibilities, the most consistent instruction across all examples seems to be:\n\n\"Rephrase the original statement into a more formal, academic tone, using appropriate synonyms, replacing contractions with full forms, and converting first-person opinions into neutral, third-person statements like 'It is my opinion that...' or similar.\"\n\nLet's test this instruction against the examples:\n\n1. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" Formal rephrase could be \"Various approaches were considered\" (passive voice) or \"It is noted that multiple approaches were considered.\" But the output is \"Various approaches were considered,\" which fits the passive conversion and uses plural. However, the original input's subject is \"I\" which is first person, but the output's subject is \"various approaches,\" third person plural. So maybe the instruction was to convert first-person to third-person plural and adjust the structure accordingly.\n\nBut why plural? Because \"I considered\" is singular, but the output is plural. That might not fit unless the instruction was to pluralize the subject regardless. But that's inconsistent with other examples. For instance, the third example starts with \"I think,\" which is first person singular, and the output is \"It is my opinion,\" which is neutral and third person. So perhaps the instruction was to convert first-person statements (including opinions) into neutral, third-person statements using more formal language, regardless of subject number.\n\nExample 3 fits: \"I think...\" → \"It is my opinion...\" (neutral, third person). Example 5: \"I got...\" → \"I understood you\" (though the original was first person, the output is still first person but more direct). Hmm, this inconsistency complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to rephrase any first-person statements into third-person statements without changing the subject. For example, \"I consider\" → \"He considers,\" but that's not what happens here. The first output is \"various approaches were considered,\" which is third person plural, not singular. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version, using \"it is my opinion\" when expressing an opinion, and replacing contractions with full forms. Additionally, using more formal vocabulary (like \"tolerate\" instead of \"can't stand,\" \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up\"). Also, adjusting noun phrases to more precise terms (\"many approaches\" → \"various,\" \"whole story\" → \"entire\").\n\nLooking back at all examples, the most comprehensive instruction that fits all outputs would be something like:\n\n\"Your task is to rephrase the given sentence into a more formal and academic tone. This involves replacing informal expressions with their formal equivalents, avoiding contractions, and converting first-person opinions into neutral, third-person statements using phrases like 'it is my opinion that.' Additionally, ensure that any vague or colloquial language is replaced with more precise terminology.\"\n\nTesting this against the examples:\n\n1. \"I considered many approaches.\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" (Formal, passive, more precise \"various\" instead of \"many.\")\n\n2. \"I can't stand his temper.\" → \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" (Replacing contraction with full form, informal \"can't stand\" with \"tolerate.\")\n\n3. \"I think that this is interesting.\" → \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" (Converting first-person opinion to neutral third-person statement.)\n\n4. \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" (Replacing \"whole\" with \"entire,\" informal \"made up\" with formal \"fabricated.\")\n\n5. \"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\" (Shortening the phrase while maintaining the core meaning, avoiding \"got.\")\n\nThis seems to cover all the transformations observed. Each output corresponds to applying this formalization process to the input. The key elements are replacing contractions with full forms, using neutral/academic phrasing, precise vocabulary, and rephrasing first-person opinions into third-person or neutral statements.\n\nTherefore, the instruction was likely: \"Rephrase each sentence into a more formal tone by replacing contractions with their full forms, using neutral language instead of colloquial expressions, and converting any first-person opinions into third-person or neutral statements like 'it is my opinion that...' or similar.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to your friend was to **rephrase each sentence into a more formal tone** by implementing the following transformations:\n\n1. **Replace Contractions**: Convert informal contractions (e.g., \"can't stand\") to their full forms (e.g., \"cannot tolerate\").\n2. **Neutralize Personal Opinions**: Replace first-person expressions of opinion (e.g., \"I think that...\") with neutral, third-person statements like \"It is my opinion that...\" or similar.\n3. **Use Precision Over Colloquialisms**: Substitute vague or casual terms (e.g., \"made up\" → \"fabricated\"; \"whole\" → \"entire\") with more precise vocabulary.\n4. **Avoid Casual Phrases**: Simplify or eliminate colloquial expressions (e.g., \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\").\n\n**Example Breakdown**",

Hmm, the outputs all seem to be rephrased versions of the inputs, but with some specific changes. Let me go through each example step by step.\n\nStarting with the first pair:\nInput: She looks like her sister.\nOutput: She resembles her sister.\nSo here, \"looks like\" was changed to \"resembles\". Maybe the instruction was to replace certain verbs or phrases with synonyms? But let's check other examples to see if that's a pattern.\n\nSecond input:\nI think that this is interesting.\nOutput: It is my opinion that this is interesting.\nOh, here they replaced \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion\". That seems like a common restructuring to make it more formal or indirect. So maybe the instruction was to convert first-person statements into third-person opinions?\n\nThird input:\nI got what you said.\nOutput: I understood you.\nHere, \"got what\" was turned into \"understood\". Maybe replacing informal expressions with their direct equivalents?\n\nFourth input:\nSee you tonight.\nOutput: I look forward to meeting you tonight.\nThis is a transformation from a casual greeting to a more polite expression. So perhaps the instruction was to formalize or rephrase greetings into expectations of meeting?\n\nFifth input:\nThe lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\nOutput: The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\nIn this case, they added a relative pronoun \"whom\" instead of using the subject form \"I met\". Wait, but in the output, it's \"whom I met\", which is adding the relative pronoun. But \"met\" is already there. Wait, the original input is \"I met\", but the output uses \"whom I met\". So maybe replacing possessive forms or changing pronouns?\n\nWait, no. The input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the change here is replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met\". So changing \"I\" to \"whom\"? That's not a standard substitution. Wait, but \"whom\" is the objective case. So maybe the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"who/whom\" when necessary, or perhaps in cases where the clause requires the objective case. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to insert relative pronouns in certain positions. But why \"whom\" specifically here? Let's see: the structure is \"The lawyer [I met]...\" So changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" would turn the direct object \"me\" into \"whom\". So maybe the instruction was to convert subject pronouns to their object forms when used as objects in clauses?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to adjust pronoun case based on grammatical function. In the fifth input, the pronoun \"I\" is the subject of \"met\", but in the output, it becomes \"whom\", which is the object form. So maybe the instruction was to rewrite clauses with pronouns in certain contexts. This seems a bit more complex than the other examples, which were more about replacing words or phrases with synonyms or rephrasing structures.\n\nNow, looking back at all examples, they have different transformations. The first replaces \"looks like\" with \"resembles\", second turns \"I think\" into \"my opinion\", third shortens \"got what you said\" to \"understood\", fourth changes a casual farewell to a polite one, fifth adds \"whom\" to the possessive phrase. These transformations don't all fit the same rule, so the original instruction might have been a combination of different rephrasing tasks. However, since the user says the friend followed an instruction, it's likely that the instruction provided a set of rules or a task that encompasses all these examples.\n\nLet me consider possible instructions:\n\n1. Rewrite each input sentence using more formal language.\n   - The second example fits (\"I think\" → \"my opinion\"). The fourth example is formalized too. The first could be seen as a synonym replacement, but maybe part of making it more formal. The fifth example doesn't seem directly formal; adding \"whom\" might be considered formal. The third example is informal → more direct (but not sure). So maybe not all examples are about formality.\n\n2. Replace idiomatic expressions with more straightforward equivalents.\n   - First example: \"looks like\" is a colloquial expression; \"resembles\" is more direct.\n   - Third example: \"got what\" is informal, replaced with \"understood\".\n   - Fourth example: \"see you\" is casual, replaced with \"look forward to meeting\".\n\n3. Change pronoun cases where appropriate.\n   - Fifth example adds \"whom\", which is the object form. The input had \"I met\", but the output uses \"whom I met\", turning \"I\" into \"whom\". So maybe the instruction was to adjust pronouns to their correct cases based on their grammatical function.\n\n4. Use more precise verb tenses or aspects.\n   - Not sure here. The first input uses past simple, output does the same. Second example uses present tense in output, input used \"think\" (present). So that doesn't fit.\n\n5. Restructure sentences to avoid certain words.\n   - For example, replacing \"I think\" with \"it is my opinion\" removes the first-person subject.\n\n6. Use alternative conjunctions or connectors.\n   - No clear pattern here.\n\nPutting all together, the most probable instruction is a combination of two main tasks: \n\na) Convert first-person pronouns into third-person forms or use indirect expressions (like replacing \"I think\" with \"my opinion\").\nb) Replace colloquial phrases with more formal or direct equivalents (e.g., \"she looks like\" vs \"resembles\", \"got what\" → \"understood\", \"see you\" → \"look forward\").\n\nBut the fifth example adds \"whom\", which is a more grammatical adjustment. So perhaps the instruction was to adjust pronoun cases in certain clauses. For example, whenever \"I\" is used in a relative clause, replace it with \"who/whom\" depending on the grammatical function.\n\nWait, in the fifth input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, \"I met\" is the past tense of \"to meet\", so \"I\" is the subject of the clause \"I met\". The output is \"whom I met\". Wait, but \"met\" is a verb, not a noun. So \"I met\" is a subject-verb structure. Changing \"I\" to \"whom\" would require \"met\" to become \"met whom\", which is incorrect. Wait, no. Wait, in the original input, it's \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So they inserted \"whom\" between \"lawyer\" and \"I met\". But why?\n\nAh, maybe the instruction was to add the relative pronoun when referring to the person met. For example, changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" when the subject is the lawyer. But that doesn't make sense grammatically. Wait, perhaps the original instruction was to rephrase \"I met\" as \"whom I met\" in such contexts. That would be replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" when it's the subject of the relative clause. But that's a very specific substitution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to use relative pronouns instead of possessives. The input has \"I met yesterday\", and the output is \"whom I met yesterday\". Wait, but that still doesn't fit. Another possibility: the instruction was to convert possessive nouns into relative clauses. But \"lawyer I met\" isn't a possessive noun phrase. The original input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" So \"I met\" is a past participle, but that's not a noun. So maybe the instruction was to add a relative clause to \"lawyer\" by inserting \"whom\" before \"I met\". But why would that happen? Unless there was a misunderstanding in the input structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original instruction was to replace the possessive pronoun in the input with a relative pronoun. For example, if the input had \"My brother\", change it to \"The brother whom I met\". But in the given example, it's \"The lawyer I met yesterday\", which doesn't seem to fit.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try to see if there's a common thread across all outputs. Let's list them again:\n\n1. Looks like → resembles.\n2. I think → It is my opinion.\n3. Got what → understood.\n4. See you → look forward to meeting you.\n5. I met → whom I met.\n\nThe key differences are in the way these phrases are handled. Each output seems to be a substitution of a phrase or word with another. Let's see:\n\nFor the first example, \"looks like\" is replaced with \"resembles\". Both are verbs meaning similar. Maybe synonyms or more formal terms.\n\nSecond example is a change from first-person to third-person opinion. That's a different transformation.\n\nThird is replacing an informal phrase with a more direct statement.\n\nFourth is a greeting converted into a positive expectation.\n\nFifth is a possessive-like phrase turned into a relative clause with \"whom\".\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to replace \"I\" with \"you\" in certain contexts, but none of the examples show that.\n\nAnother angle: Perhaps the instruction was to translate the inputs into another language and then back, leading to slight paraphrases. But the outputs are too similar to the inputs for that.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to convert each sentence into its passive voice equivalent, but none of the outputs look passive.\n\nWait, looking at the first input: \"She looks like her sister.\" Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" So same subject, but a synonym for the verb. So perhaps the instruction was to replace certain verbs with their synonyms.\n\nThen, the second input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" Here, \"I think\" is transformed into \"my opinion\". So maybe the instruction was to replace \"I think\" with \"my opinion\" or something similar. But why only when \"I think\" is followed by a clause?\n\nThird input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" So replacing \"got what\" with \"understood\", and removing the speaker's name. Maybe the instruction was to convert reported speech into direct understanding.\n\nFourth input: \"See you tonight.\" Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" So changing the casual greeting into a more formal anticipation.\n\nFifth input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". So maybe replacing the possessive \"I\" with \"whom\" in certain contexts. For instance, when referring to someone you met earlier.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more formal version, sometimes replacing pronouns or phrases, and sometimes changing verb forms.\n\nBut how do all these examples fit under a single instruction? Let's think of possible instructions that could generate all these outputs.\n\nOption 1: Rewrite each input to make it more formal, using third-person perspective where applicable, replacing contractions, and avoiding slang.\n\nBut why the fifth example? Adding \"whom\" isn't part of standard formality.\n\nOption 2: Use a translation tool that substitutes synonyms and restructures sentences. But again, not sure.\n\nWait, the fifth example is a bit confusing. Let's analyze it more closely:\n\nOriginal: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\nOutput: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\nThe difference is the insertion of \"whom\". So the instruction could have been to insert the relative pronoun \"whom\" after the noun \"lawyer\" when followed by a clause where the subject is the speaker. Or maybe when referring to a person met. But why \"whom\" and not \"who\"?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to adjust the pronoun case based on the grammatical function. For example, if the subject of the main clause is a pronoun, then use the appropriate form in the relative clause.\n\nIn the original input, \"I met\" is the subject of the relative clause \"who/I met\". The output uses \"whom\", which is the objective case. So maybe the instruction was to always use the objective case in such relative clauses. But why only here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to use \"whom\" instead of \"I\" when the speaker is the subject of the relative clause. Because \"I met\" is the subject, so \"whom\" is needed here to maintain agreement in case.\n\nWait, in grammar, when the subject of the relative clause is the speaker, we use \"who\" (subjective) because the clause is functioning as the subject of the main clause. But in this case, \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful\" is structured as \"The lawyer [that/who/whom I met]...\". Here, the relative clause is \"I met yesterday\", but the subject of the main clause is \"lawyer\", which is \"was helpful\". The relative clause is describing the lawyer, so the relative pronoun should be \"who\" or \"whom\" depending on the function. Since the main clause subject is \"lawyer\", the relative clause's subject is \"I met yesterday\"—but that's awkward. Wait, actually, the structure is \"The lawyer [that/who/whom I met yesterday] was helpful.\" The relative pronoun refers back to \"lawyer\", so the relative clause is \"I met yesterday\" as part of the description of the lawyer. So \"I met\" is the past tense of \"to meet\", and the subject of the relative clause is \"lawyer\". Wait, no. The main clause is \"The lawyer was helpful.\" The relative clause is \"that/who/whom I met yesterday\". So the relative pronoun should refer to the lawyer, not to \"met\". So the relative pronoun here is \"who\" or \"whom\" as the subject of \"met yesterday\". Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me break it down. The sentence is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" So \"lawyer\" is the subject of the main clause, and \"I met yesterday\" is a participle phrase modifying \"lawyer\". There's no relative clause here. The output changes it to \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Now, the structure is \"The lawyer [whom I met yesterday] was helpful.\" So now, the relative pronoun \"whom\" is the object of \"met yesterday\". Therefore, the original input didn't have a relative clause, but the output introduced one by adding \"whom\".\n\nAh! So the original instruction might have been to insert a relative pronoun \"whom\" before the verb \"met\" when referring to a person met. But why in this case? Perhaps the instruction was to add relative clauses when possible to make the sentence more formal. But that doesn't explain the others.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to replace certain prepositional phrases with relative clauses. But this is a stretch.\n\nLooking at the fifth example again: the input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" The addition of \"whom\" turns \"I met\" into \"whom I met\". This seems like the instruction was to convert \"I met\" into \"whom I met\" when referring to a previously mentioned person. But that's a very specific substitution.\n\nConsidering all examples, the fifth one stands out as requiring a more grammatical adjustment. The other examples involve word substitutions or rephrasing for formality. Given that the friend produced outputs with varying transformations, the instruction must cover multiple types of rephrasing. But to find a single instruction that encompasses all these, perhaps the instruction was to translate each sentence into its most formal equivalent, replacing colloquial expressions, rephrasing pronouns and verbs, and adding relative clauses where necessary. However, the fifth example's transformation is a bit unique, suggesting a different rule applied specifically there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each sentence by replacing \"I\" with \"who/whom\" in certain positions. For example, when \"I\" is the subject of the main clause and appears in a relative clause, replace it with \"whom\".\n\nBut without more context, it's challenging. Another approach: look for common elements in all the outputs. Let's list the outputs again with their transformations:\n\n1. \"She looks like her sister.\" → \"resembles\".\n2. \"I think that...\" → \"my opinion that...\".\n3. \"I got what you said.\" → \"understood you.\".\n4. \"See you...\" → \"look forward to meeting you...\".\n5. \"The lawyer I met yesterday...\" → \"whom I met yesterday\".\n\nWhat's common here? The first four examples involve replacing parts of the sentence with synonyms or rephrased structures. The fifth involves grammatical adjustment. So maybe the instruction was a combination of different tasks, but the user wants a single instruction that the friend followed to generate all outputs.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to apply specific replacements or transformations for each part of speech or phrase. For example, replacing first-person singular subject pronouns with \"you\", but that doesn't fit any of the examples except possibly the second, which replaces \"I think\" with \"my opinion\".\n\nWait, in the second example: \"I think\" becomes \"It is my opinion\". This is a common way to express personal opinions in more formal English. So maybe the instruction was to convert expressions of personal opinion into statements of the speaker's opinion, often using \"my opinion that\" or similar constructions.\n\nSimilarly, in the fifth example, inserting \"whom\" might be part of adjusting pronouns in certain clauses. If the instruction was to use \"whom\" when referring to the speaker in a relative clause, but that's not a standard rule. Usually, \"who\" is used as the subject, \"whom\" as the object.\n\nBut the fifth example doesn't have a relative clause in the output; the original had \"I met\", and the output adds \"whom\". So the instruction could have been to insert \"whom\" before the past participle when it refers to a person met. But why in this case? Without further examples, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother angle: Perhaps the instruction was to apply multiple transformations to each input. For example, each input required two steps: first, rephrasing the sentence into a more formal tone (like replacing \"I think\" with \"my opinion\"), and second, applying specific grammatical corrections (like inserting \"whom\" in the fifth example).\n\nBut since the user lists the instruction as a single task leading to the outputs, it's more likely that the instruction was a set of rules that could be applied universally, even if not all examples follow all rules.\n\nLet me hypothesize: The instruction was to rephrase each sentence into a more formal version. To do this, replace certain phrases (like \"I think\" → \"my opinion\"), use more formal vocabulary (like \"resembles\" instead of \"looks like\"), avoid contractions and slang (like changing \"got what\" to \"understood\"), formalize greetings (\"see you\" → \"look forward to meeting\"), and adjust pronoun cases where necessary (like \"I\" to \"whom\" in specific clauses). \n\nBut how do all these fit into a single",

Hmm, each input has a specific transformation in the output. Let me start by looking at each pair individually to see if I can spot a pattern or rule.\n\nFirst pair: Input is \"I considered many approaches.\" Output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" So here, the subject and verb got swapped, and \"many\" became \"various\". The structure changed from \"I + past participle\" to \"Various + noun phrase + were considered\".\n\nSecond pair: Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Here, \"whole\" becomes \"entire\", and \"made up\" changes to \"fabricated\". The subject remains the same, but the adjective and the verb are replaced with their synonyms or related terms.\n\nThird input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the output adds a relative pronoun \"whom\" to replace the indirect object pronoun \"I\". Also, the word order shifts slightly.\n\nFourth input: \"See you tonight.\" Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" The input is a casual greeting, but the output turns it into a more formal expression using \"look forward to\" instead of \"see you\".\n\nFifth input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" Again, changing \"can't tell the difference\" to a more formal phrasing with \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n\nNow, looking at all these outputs, I notice that the instruction might be asking the friend to transform certain expressions into more formal or standard phrasing. Let's break down each possible pattern:\n\n1. For the first input, the output swapped \"I considered\" to \"Various approaches were considered\". So maybe replacing first-person pronouns (I) with third-person plural possessives (Various) and restructuring the sentence to passive voice?\n\n2. The second input replaced \"whole story\" with \"entire story\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\". Both are paraphrases, likely synonyms with more formal tone.\n\n3. Third input added \"whom\" to the clause. \"I met\" became \"whom I met\". So perhaps converting indirect objects (like \"I met you\") to relative clauses with \"whom\"?\n\n4. Fourth input turned \"See you...\" into \"I look forward...\". This is a common transformation in English where casual meet-ups are expressed as looking forward to something.\n\n5. Fifth input replaced \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish\". These are more formal alternatives.\n\nPutting this together, the instruction could be to rephrase each input into a more formal or standard English version. Each output seems to have adjusted the wording to a more polite, perhaps academic or professional tone. \n\nLet me check if all transformations fit this hypothesis. For example:\n\n- First input: \"I considered\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered\" — using \"were considered\" instead of \"I was considering\" (but wait, the original is in past tense). Wait, \"considered\" here is in passive voice. Maybe the instruction is to convert active to passive? But then why the first example uses \"Various\" instead of \"I\" as the subject?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to change first-person singular (\"I\") to third-person plural (\"Various\"), making it more general. The original input says \"I considered\", so the output is phrased as a general statement about various approaches being considered.\n\nSo the rule might be: Replace any instance of \"I\" with \"Various\" when the subject is the person doing the action, and then rephrase the sentence structure to passive voice. But in the second example, there's no \"I\" involved, just a noun. So that might not hold.\n\nWait, the second example doesn't have \"I\", so maybe the instruction is different. Let's think again.\n\nAnother angle: Perhaps the instruction is to make the output more formal by using synonyms and more precise language. For example, \"whole\" to \"entire\", \"made up\" to \"fabricated\", which are more formal terms. Similarly, replacing contractions like \"can't\" with \"find it hard to\", and changing the structure of the greeting.\n\nLooking at the third example, adding \"whom\" suggests changing the pronoun to a relative pronoun. In the input, \"I met yesterday\" becomes \"whom I met yesterday\". So perhaps replacing direct or indirect object pronouns with relative clauses starting with \"whom\".\n\nThe fourth example converts a casual greeting into a formal statement of anticipation, which is a common politeness formula.\n\nThe fifth example replaces a negative phrase (\"can't tell\") with a more diplomatic expression.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to transform the inputs into more formal, polite, or precise English. To do this, each input needs to be adjusted according to certain rules:\n\n1. Change \"I\" to \"Various\" when the subject is the agent performing the action, and rephrase the sentence structure to passive voice.\n2. Use more formal or synonym terms (e.g., \"whole\" -> \"entire\", \"made up\" -> \"fabricated\").\n3. Convert contractions like \"can't\" into more formal phrasing.\n4. Replace direct addresses (greetings like \"See you\") with statements about looking forward.\n5. Convert simple past actions into more precise structures (like adding \"whom\" in the third example).\n\nBut how to generalize this into an instruction? The key is that the instruction likely asks for transforming each input into a more formal version, possibly involving synonyms, rephrasing, changing sentence structure, and adjusting politeness levels.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see if there's a common element in all the outputs. For example, each output seems to use more formal language. The first output uses \"Various approaches were considered\" instead of \"I considered many approaches.\" The second uses \"entire\" and \"fabricated\". The third adds \"whom\". Fourth and fifth are more about adjusting phrasing rather than vocabulary.\n\nSo the instruction might be something like: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal and precise version, using appropriate synonyms, adjusting sentence structure, and choosing appropriate expressions for politeness.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to replace first-person singular pronouns with third-person plural possessive nouns and adjust the sentence accordingly. But then the second example doesn't have an \"I\". So that might not be it.\n\nWait, looking back at the second input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Here, \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated\", which is a synonym. So replacing colloquial expressions with more formal ones.\n\nThird input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So here, replacing the indirect object \"I met\" with a relative clause starting with \"whom\".\n\nFourth: \"See you...\" becomes \"I look forward...\" — a common way to respond to greetings.\n\nFifth: \"can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish\" — more formal and precise.\n\nPutting all this together, the instruction is probably to rewrite each input in a more formal, precise, or polite manner. Each output follows this general guideline but with specific transformations tailored to the input. So the instruction might be something like: \"Transform each input into a more formal and precise English version, using appropriate synonyms, adjusting sentence structure, and choosing suitable phrases for politeness and clarity.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal and precise English version**, often involving:\n- Replacing informal expressions with synonyms or more precise language (e.g., \"whole\" → \"entire\", \"made up\" → \"fabricated\").\n- Converting first-person pronouns (\"I\") to third-person references (e.g., \"Various approaches were considered\") or adjusting sentence structure (e.g., adding relative pronouns like \"whom\").\n- Polishing greetings (e.g., \"See you...\" → \"I look forward...\") or softening language (e.g., \"can’t tell...\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\").\n\nEach output exemplifies transforming the input for clarity, formality, or social appropriateness. \n\n**Final Answer**:  \nThe instruction was to **convert each input into a more formal and precise English version**, emphasizing clarity, politeness, and precision through synonym substitution, structural adjustments, and refined phrasing.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

So, we have five input-output pairs, and the task is to determine what the original instruction could have been that led to these outputs. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me look at the examples and see if I can spot any patterns or common transformations between the inputs and outputs. Let me list them again:\n\n1. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n   Difference here is replacing \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion\". So maybe the instruction is about restating the thought in a more formal way.\n\n2. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n   Here, the input is a gratitude message, and the output converts it into a different phrasing using \"assistance\" and adding \"much appreciated\". So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase gratitude expressions into more formal or specific terms?\n\n3. Input: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\n   The output takes the colloquial term \"fire\" and replaces it with a more standard adjective. So maybe the instruction is to replace informal expressions with more formal or standard language.\n\n4. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n   Changing \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\". Both express disapproval but using different phrasing. The instruction might be to rephrase negative reactions using more formal synonyms.\n\n5. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n   Replacing \"looks like\" with \"resembles\". Both mean similar things but different collocations. The instruction might be to substitute certain verb phrases with synonyms or different structures.\n\nLooking at all these, there's a mix of replacing parts of speech, changing sentence structure, using synonyms, or rephrasing. Let me see if these examples fit a common pattern.\n\nAnother approach: What's the same across all outputs? They are all slightly rephrased versions of the inputs, maintaining the general meaning but adjusting vocabulary, structure, or formality. Maybe the instruction was to paraphrase each input into a more formal or specific version.\n\nWait, let's check each example against that hypothesis.\n\n1. \"I think...\" becomes \"It is my opinion...\" – definitely more formal and passive voice.\n2. Gratitude to \"Your assistance...appreciated\" – more formal and specific.\n3. \"is fire\" replaced with \"incredibly good\" – replacing slang with a stronger positive adjective.\n4. \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\" – both express dislike, but different verbs.\n5. \"looks like\" to \"resembles\" – synonym replacement.\n\nSo all these outputs seem to be rephrasing the original input with some variation in formality, vocabulary, or phrasing. Therefore, the instruction might have been something like \"Paraphrase the given statement into a more formal version or restate it using synonyms where appropriate.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was more specific, like converting informal expressions to more standard ones. But considering all cases, a general paraphrasing instruction makes sense.\n\nBut let me double-check. Are there other possibilities? For example, maybe it's about translating from one language to another, but the examples don't show that. The outputs are in English, so probably not translation.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the instruction was to rephrase in a way that adds detail or nuance, but in these examples, the outputs are either more formal, use synonyms, or adjust structure. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, sometimes they have additional elements. Like the first input adds \"my opinion\", the third adds \"incredibly\", the fourth adds \"much\" (even though it's already there in the output). Wait, no, the fourth input is \"I can't stand his temper.\" The output is \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" So \"can't stand\" vs \"cannot tolerate\". Both are negative, but different verb phrases.\n\nHmm. So the instruction could be to replace certain collocations with their synonyms. For example, replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\".\n\nBut then why does the second example convert \"Thanks for your help\" into \"Your assistance is much appreciated\"? That's a bit more complex. So maybe the instruction is broader: take the input and rephrase it in a way that's more polite or formal, possibly using synonyms, adjusting structure, etc.\n\nAnother possibility: The instruction might be to convert each sentence into a more specific or precise version. For example, making sure adjectives are strong or precise. Like \"fire\" becoming \"incredibly good\", which is stronger. \"Looks like\" is a bit generic, so \"resembles\" is more precise.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to make each output a more polite or formal response. Like turning gratitude into something more formal. But \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" is already formal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert statements into opinions. Wait, the first example does that: \"I think...\" becomes \"It is my opinion...\". The second example doesn't turn the gratitude into an opinion; it's still a statement. So that doesn't fit.\n\nSo perhaps the main theme here is rephrasing the input in various ways to express the same idea but with different words or structures. So the instruction was to paraphrase each input into a rephrased version, possibly making it more formal, precise, or using synonyms.\n\nTherefore, the most likely instruction was something along the lines of: \"Paraphrase each input into a rephrased version using synonyms, adjusting structure, or changing formality level.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was more specific, such as converting each input into an opinion-based statement when possible. But in the first example, it works, but the second example doesn't become an opinion. So that might not be the case.\n\nWait, the first input was a statement of opinion (\"I think\"), and the output is also an opinion phrased differently. The second input was a gratitude statement, which isn't an opinion, so converting it to an opinion-based output would make sense here. Similarly, the third input is a statement of fact, which the output reinforces with \"incredibly good\". The fourth is a negative reaction, which becomes a statement of inability to tolerate. The fifth is a similarity observation becoming a resemblance.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to take each input and rephrase it into an opinion-based statement when applicable, but also adjust formality, use synonyms, etc. However, not all inputs are opinions. The second input is a gratitude message, which is turned into a more formal expression of thanks.\n\nSo combining all these, the instruction likely involved taking each input and rephrasing it into a more formal, precise, or opinionated version, possibly using synonyms or restructuring the sentence.\n\nTherefore, the instruction could have been: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal, specific, or opinionated statement, adjusting word choice and sentence structure as needed.\"\n\nAlternatively, since the examples include both adding details (like \"my opinion\") and using synonyms (\"assistance\" instead of \"help\"), maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more detailed or precise version, possibly expanding on the original ideas.\n\nIn any case, the key elements seem to be rephrasing, adjusting formality, and using synonyms where possible. The outputs consistently show variations in vocabulary, structure, or formality, which points towards a paraphrasing task.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to the friend was likely to **paraphrase each input into a rephrased version using synonyms, adjusting structure, or modifying formality**. \n\n### Key Analysis:\n- **Formalization**: Inputs were transformed into more formal language (e.g., replacing \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion\").\n- **Synonym Replacement**: Colloquial terms (e.g., \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\") or less specific phrases (\"looks like\" → \"resembles\") were replaced with precise alternatives.\n- **Structural Adjustments**: Sentence structure changes (e.g., converting gratitude into formal expressions like \"Your assistance is much appreciated\") or rephrasing negative reactions (e.g., \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\").\n\n### Final Instruction:\n\"Rephrase each input into a more formal, precise, or opinionated statement by adjusting vocabulary, sentence structure, or formality as needed.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

    "instruction_outputs": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nI gave a friend an instruction and five inputs. The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs.\nHere are the input-output pairs:\n\nInput: The whole story was made up.\nOutput: The entire story was fabricated.\n\nInput: This song is fire.\nOutput: This song is incredibly good.\n\nInput: She looks like her sister.\nOutput: She resembles her sister.\n\nInput: See you tonight.\nOutput: I look forward to meeting you tonight.\n\nInput: I can't stand his temper.\nOutput: I cannot tolerate his temper.\n\nThe instruction was<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<|begin_of_thought|>Okay, let's try to figure out what the original instruction was that the friend followed. The friend took five different inputs and produced outputs based on some transformation or rule. So, I need to find a common pattern or rule that applies to all these pairs.\n\nFirst, let's list out the input-output pairs again to see if there's a clear pattern:\n\n1. Input: The whole story was made up.\n   Output: The entire story was fabricated.\n\n2. Input: This song is fire.\n   Output: This song is incredibly good.\n\n3. Input: She looks like her sister.\n   Output: She resembles her sister.\n\n4. Input: See you tonight.\n   Output: I look forward to meeting you tonight.\n\n5. Input: I can't stand his temper.\n   Output: I cannot tolerate his temper.\n\nHmm. Let's break each pair down.\n\nStarting with the first one: \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated\". Both mean something is fictional. But \"fabricated\" is more formal. Maybe the instruction was to replace certain words with synonyms or more formal terms? Let's check other pairs.\n\nSecond input: \"fire\" becomes \"incredibly good\". Wait, \"fire\" here is used as slang to mean 'amazing' or 'lit'. The output uses \"incredibly good\", which is a direct synonym but maybe more formal. Alternatively, could it be replacing an informal term with a more positive phrase? But \"fire\" here isn't exactly a negative. Maybe the instruction was to convert informal expressions into more standard phrasing?\n\nThird input: \"looks like\" becomes \"resembles\". They're similar but \"resembles\" is more precise or perhaps formal. So maybe replacing collocations with more precise or formal equivalents.\n\nFourth input: \"See you tonight\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" Here, the input is an informal greeting, and the output is a more formal response. The friend turned the informal into a more polite, expected reaction.\n\nFifth input: \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate\". Again, informal expression replaced with a more formal term, but both express disapproval. However, \"stand\" and \"tolerate\" have slightly different connotations—tolerate might imply accepting something less desirable than standing for it, perhaps.\n\nWait, but looking at the third pair: \"She looks like her sister\" vs \"resembles\". \"Looks like\" is a common phrasing, but \"resembles\" is more accurate and perhaps more formal. So maybe the rule is to replace informal phrases with more precise or formal terms.\n\nBut then the second input: \"This song is fire\" becomes \"incredibly good\". So \"fire\" here is slang meaning excellent. The output is a more explicit positive adjective. That seems like replacing slang with a synonym.\n\nSo the possible rules could involve two things: formalizing language (replacing colloquialisms with more formal terms) and also converting informal positive slang into more direct praise.\n\nLooking at the fourth input: the output is not just formalizing but rephrasing the entire sentence. \"See you\" is transformed into \"I look forward to...\", which changes the perspective from future-oriented to expressing anticipation. So maybe there's a combination of both formality and rephrasing based on context or type of expression.\n\nBut wait, the fifth input also transforms \"can't stand\" into \"cannot tolerate\". So replacing informal verb phrases with more formal ones. But in this case, they're still expressing a similar sentiment but with different phrasing.\n\nWait, let me re-examine each pair again with this in mind.\n\n1. Made up → fabricated: formal synonym.\n2. Fire → incredibly good: slang to explicit praise.\n3. Looks like → resembles: more precise phrasing.\n4. See you → look forward to meeting: formal and rephrasing from future to anticipation.\n5. Can't stand → cannot tolerate: more formal phrasing.\n\nSo maybe the instruction is to replace informal or colloquial expressions with their more formal equivalents. But that doesn't fully capture the fourth pair, which is a complete sentence transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to transform the input into a more polite or professional response. For example:\n\n- For informal statements of opinion (like \"This song is fire\"), convert them into a more positive and formal statement.\n- For expressions of disapproval (\"I can't stand his temper\"), replace them with a more formal way of expressing dislike.\n- For phrases like \"See you tonight,\" turn it into a more formal response expressing anticipation.\n- For collocations like \"look like,\" use the more precise \"resemble.\"\n- For \"the whole story was made up,\" use a synonym for fictional.\n\nBut this seems a bit scattered. Let's think if there's a common thread.\n\nAnother angle: the outputs seem to be more formal versions of the inputs, possibly through vocabulary substitution, paraphrasing, or adjusting politeness levels. Let's check each pair:\n\n1. \"Made up\" (slang for fictional) → \"Fabricated\" (formal).\n2. \"Fire\" (slang for awesome) → \"Incredibly good\" (formal praise).\n3. \"Looks like\" → \"Resembles\" (more precise).\n4. \"See you\" → \"Look forward to meeting\" (polite rephrasing).\n5. \"Can't stand\" → \"Cannot tolerate\" (more formal disapproval).\n\nSo combining these observations:\n\n- Replace slang/colloquial terms with their formal counterparts or precise equivalents.\n- Convert informal expressions of opinion/feelings into more positive or formal statements.\n- Transform casual greetings into more polite anticipatory responses.\n- Use more formal verbs for expressions of disapproval or dislike.\n\nBut perhaps there's a more unified instruction. Let me think about possible instruction phrases.\n\nFor instance, \"Convert informal expressions into formal equivalents while maintaining the original meaning.\" But does that cover all cases? Let's see:\n\n- First input: informal slang \"made up\" (as in fabricated) converted to formal \"fabricated.\" That fits.\n- Second input: informal slang \"fire\" (meaning great) converted to formal \"incredibly good.\"\n- Third input: collocation \"looks like\" is informal; \"resembles\" is more precise.\n- Fourth input: informal \"see you\" is converted to a more formal and polite \"look forward to...\" which is a rephrasing rather than direct equivalent, but maintains the intent.\n- Fifth input: informal \"can't stand\" is converted to formal \"cannot tolerate,\" preserving the sentiment.\n\nSo maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into more formal, precise, or polite language where appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, could it be a translation into a more standard or academic register?\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to replace certain words with their synonyms or more accurate alternatives, especially in cases where the input uses informal terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to turn informal expressions into more positive affirmations. For example, replacing negative or neutral expressions with positive ones.\n\nLooking at the fourth input: \"See you tonight\" is turned into \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" That's a shift in subject (from \"you\" to \"I\") and transforming the casual greeting into a more positive anticipation.\n\nSimilarly, the fifth input turns a complaint into a more formal expression of displeasure.\n\nThe third input is about replacing \"looks like\" with a more accurate verb.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction had multiple parts:\n\n1. Replace informal expressions with formal equivalents.\n2. Convert negative or neutral expressions into more positive ones when possible.\n3. Rephrase greetings into more formal expressions of anticipation.\n4. Adjust collocations to more precise terms.\n\nBut this seems a bit too vague. Maybe the instruction was to use a thesaurus replacement tool, but the examples vary between synonyms, collocation replacements, and sentence restructuring.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to replace certain words or phrases with their thesaurus entries. But why would \"fire\" become \"incredibly good\"? Because \"fire\" here is slang for excellent, so \"incredibly good\" is a direct replacement of the slang term with a synonym. But \"fabricated\" is a synonym, but \"made up\" is a common phrasing. So maybe the instruction was to replace specific words with their thesaurus entries where applicable, but only when they fit.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction was to \"make the sentence more formal by replacing informal terms and adjusting collocations.\" This would explain the first, third, fifth pairs. But the second and fourth pairs require additional processing beyond mere formalization.\n\nThe fourth pair involves rephrasing the entire sentence from an informal greeting to a more formal response. So perhaps the instruction had multiple steps or covered different types of transformations depending on the input's context or part of speech.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to \"convert each input into a more polite and formal version of the original sentence, using appropriate vocabulary and phrasing.\" This would cover all the examples except the fourth input, which is a greeting transformed into anticipation. So perhaps there's another aspect to the instruction.\n\nWait, the fourth input's output is not a formality adjustment but a different kind of transformation. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more positive or professional tone, regardless of formality. For example:\n\n- For any expression of approval or enthusiasm (\"fire\"), convert it into a more explicit positive statement.\n- For expressions of disapproval or dislike (\"can't stand\"), rephrase them into more formal or precise terms.\n- For greetings like \"see you,\" transform them into a response that expresses anticipation.\n- For collocations like \"look like,\" use the more precise \"resemble.\"\n- For statements about stories being made up, use the synonym \"fabricated.\"\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was a combination of these different transformation types: adjusting formality, positivity, collocation precision, and specific phrase rephrasing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more standard or correct form, considering common usage errors. For example:\n\n- \"made up\" (incorrect) → \"fabricated\" (correct)\n- \"fire\" (slang) → \"incredibly good\" (standard praise)\n- \"look like\" (neutral) → \"resemble\" (more precise)\n- \"see you\" (informal greeting) → \"I look forward to...\" (correct response)\n- \"can't stand\" (incorrect grammar?) → \"cannot tolerate\" (correct)\n\nBut checking grammar: \"I can't stand\" is correct. The output is grammatically correct. So maybe it's about adjusting grammar or word choice for correctness. However, \"can't stand\" and \"cannot tolerate\" are both correct, but maybe the instruction was to make the verb agreement correct (though \"can't\" is already correct). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to correct common mistakes in the input, such as:\n\n- \"made up\" as incorrect phrasing → \"fabricated\"\n- \"fire\" as slang → \"incredibly good\"\n- \"look like\" → \"resemble\" (a common mistake to use \"look\" instead of \"resemble\")\n- \"see you\" → \"I look forward to meeting you\" (a correction from informal to more formal)\n- \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" (maybe a different way to express the same idea?)\n\nBut why \"cannot tolerate\" over \"can't bear\"? Maybe because \"tolerate\" is a more precise term here. So perhaps the instruction was to replace colloquial or incorrect phrases with more accurate or formal alternatives.\n\nAnother possibility: the instruction was to rewrite the input into a more positive or affirmative tone. For example:\n\n- Turn negative or neutral statements into positive affirmations.\n\nLooking at the inputs:\n\n1. Neutral → Positive (\"made up\" → \"fabricated\" – maybe \"fabricated\" is more positive than \"made up\"? Or perhaps \"fabricated\" is the correct term here.)\n2. Enthusiastic → More explicit praise (\"fire\" → \"incredibly good\")\n3. Descriptive → Precision (\"look like\" → \"resemble\")\n4. Greeting → Affirmation (\"see you\" → anticipation)\n5. Disapproving → Formal disapproval (\"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\")\n\nSo maybe the instruction was to adjust the tone or register of the input, making it more positive, formal, precise, or appropriate for a certain context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to \"rephrase each input into a more positive and professional version, using appropriate vocabulary and grammar.\"\n\nBut how does that cover all examples? For example, \"see you tonight\" is rephrased into \"I look forward to meeting you...\" which is a more positive and anticipatory version. Similarly, \"can't stand\" is turned into a more formal expression of dislike.\n\nSo combining all these aspects, the instruction might have been something like:\n\n\"Convert each input into a more polite, professional, or positive version of the original statement by replacing informal or slang terms with their formal or more accurate equivalents, adjusting collocations for precision, and rephrasing greetings into more formal anticipatory expressions.\"\n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler instruction. Let's see if there's a common pattern across all outputs:\n\nLooking at each pair:\n\n1. Input: The whole story was made up → Output: The entire story was fabricated. (Replace \"made up\" with \"fabricated\")\n2. Input: This song is fire → Output: This song is incredibly good. (Replace slang \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\")\n3. Input: She looks like her sister → Output: She resembles her sister. (Replace \"looks like\" with \"resembles\")\n4. Input: See you tonight → Output: I look forward to meeting you tonight. (Change subject and rephrase from future to anticipation)\n5. Input: I can't stand his temper → Output: I cannot tolerate his temper. (Replace \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\")\n\nSo each input is transformed in a different way. It's possible that the instruction was to rephrase each input according to a set of predefined rules, but those rules vary. For example:\n\n- Replace \"made up\" with \"fabricated\"\n- Replace \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\"\n- Replace \"looks like\" with \"resembles\"\n- Rephrase \"See you\" into \"I look forward to...\"\n- Replace \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\"\n\nBut this seems ad hoc. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction was to translate the input into a more standard or correct form, fixing common mistakes.\n\nAnother approach: think about what each output is trying to say compared to the input.\n\n1. \"fabricated\" is the correct term for made up.\n2. \"incredibly good\" is a direct synonym for \"fire\" (slang)\n3. \"resembles\" is more precise than \"looks like\"\n4. \"I look forward...\" is a more positive and formal response to a casual greeting\n5. \"cannot tolerate\" is a more formal way of expressing disapproval\n\nSo, in some cases, the instruction is to use synonyms, in others, to adjust grammar or phrasing, and in others, to change the perspective (from \"you\" to \"I\"). Therefore, the instruction might be a combination of different transformations.\n\nBut the user mentioned that the friend read the instruction and applied it to all inputs. So there must be a single underlying rule or set of rules that apply uniformly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to \"replace informal or colloquial expressions with their thesaurus equivalents where applicable, and adjust the sentence structure or vocabulary for clarity and formality.\"\n\nIf we take that as the instruction, then each output would be generated by replacing the specific word or phrase with its thesaurus entry, adjusting grammar or structure as needed.\n\nFor example:\n\n- \"made up\" → \"fabricated\" (thesaurus synonym)\n- \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\" (synonym for \"amazing\")\n- \"looks like\" → \"resembles\" (synonym)\n- \"see you\" → \"I look forward to...\" (a polite response, which may involve changing the subject and formality)\n- \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" (synonym for \"dislike strongly\")\n\nBut the fourth example's transformation is more about changing the perspective and formality rather than direct synonym substitution. So maybe the instruction allowed for a combination of vocabulary substitution and structural adjustments.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction was to \"convert each input into a more positive, professional, and precise version by replacing informal or incorrect terms with their thesaurus entries and adjusting the sentence structure accordingly.\"\n\nHowever, this is quite broad. To pinpoint the exact instruction, let's consider possible instructions that could result in these outputs.\n\nLooking back at the outputs:\n\n1. \"fabricated\" is the direct antonym of \"made up,\" but since \"made up\" can mean fabricated, perhaps the instruction was to replace with the correct term.\n2. \"fire\" as slang for \"awesome\" is replaced with \"incredibly good,\" which is a direct synonym.\n3. \"looks like\" → \"resembles\" is a synonym.\n4. \"See you\" → \"I look forward to...\" is a rephrasing to express anticipation.\n5. \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" is a synonym.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to \"replace informal or incorrect phrases with their thesaurus entries or more formal equivalents, adjusting where necessary to maintain coherence.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to \"use a thesaurus to find appropriate replacements for the words and phrases listed in the inputs, replacing them with their synonyms or more precise terms.\"\n\nBut given that some transformations involve rephrasing entire sentences (like the fourth input), the instruction might have required a more comprehensive approach, such as \"convert the input into a more formal, precise, or positive version by replacing words with their synonyms, adjusting collocations, and rephrasing as needed.\"\n\nBut the key is that each input-output pair follows a specific transformation rule. To determine the instruction, we need to find a common transformation that applies to all inputs.\n\nLet's analyze each pair again:\n\n1. \"made up\" → \"fabricated\": Antonym?\n   No, \"made up\" can mean composed, but \"fabricated\" is closer. But \"fabricated\" is a synonym here. However, \"made up\" is also a term for lying, so maybe the instruction was to replace slang with formal terms.\n   \n2. \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\": \"Fire\" here is slang for excellent. The output is a direct replacement with a synonym.\n   \n3. \"looks like\" → \"resembles\": Synonym replacement.\n   \n4. \"See you\" → \"I look forward to...\": Structural and tonal adjustment from casual to formal.\n   \n5. \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\": Synonym replacement for the phrasal verb.\n\nSo the only pair that involves structural change is the fourth one. The rest are either synonym replacement, collocation replacement, or synonym of a phrasal verb.\n\nBut how to generalize this into an instruction?\n\nPerhaps the instruction was to \"convert each input into a more formal, precise, or appropriate version by replacing informal terms, adjusting collocations, and ensuring correct grammar.\"\n\nBut how to apply this to all cases? For example:\n\n- \"made up\" is informal, replaced with \"fabricated\".\n- \"fire\" is slang, replaced with \"incredibly good\".\n- \"looks like\" is informal, replaced with \"resembles\".\n- \"See you\" is a greeting, converted into an anticipation expression.\n- \"can't stand\" is informal, replaced with \"cannot tolerate\".\n\nSo maybe the instruction was to \"adjust the input into a more formal, positive, or professional tone by replacing informal or slang terms with their thesaurus equivalents, adjusting collocations, and rephrasing greetings appropriately.\"\n\nAlternatively, considering",

Hmm, first, I need to look at each pair and see if there's a pattern or transformation that connects them. \n\nStarting with the first example: Input is \"Please call once you get there.\" and the output is \"Please call upon your arrival.\" So, the key change here seems to be replacing \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\". Maybe the instruction is about translating or rephrasing something? Let me check another example. Second input: \"The whole story was made up.\" becomes \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Here, \"whole\" is changed to \"entire\", and \"made up\" to \"fabricated\". So perhaps the task is to replace synonyms or certain words with more formal terms?\n\nThird input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" Wait, here the entire sentence structure changes. The input is a negative statement suggesting not doing something now, and the output is a suggestion phrased positively. That's a bigger structural change. So maybe the instruction involves rephrasing in a different voice or perspective, like changing from first person to third, or suggesting actions instead of negating them?\n\nFourth input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, the possessive pronoun 'my' is replaced with 'whom'. So that's changing the case of the possessive pronoun? Or maybe replacing 'me' with the objective form when necessary? But in the first example, the possessive 'my' became 'your', which is also a possessive but different. Wait, the input uses \"I met\", output uses \"whom I met\". So the structure here is changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\", which might indicate that when referring to oneself as the subject, we should use the object form 'whom'. But that's a grammar rule about pronoun usage. But why would the other examples not follow this? For instance, the fourth input's output changes \"my\" (possessive) to \"whom\" (objective). That's a specific grammatical correction.\n\nFifth input: \"She looks like her sister.\" becomes \"She resembles her sister.\" So \"looks like\" is changed to \"resembles\". This seems like a synonym substitution again, but more specific to certain phrases. So looking at all these transformations:\n\n1. Synonym substitution (once/upon, whole/entire, made up/fabricated, looks like/resembles)\n2. Restructuring of sentences into suggested alternatives (from negation to positive suggestion)\n3. Grammatical corrections (changing \"my\" to \"whom\")\n4. Possibly changing pronouns or other parts of speech.\n\nSo putting this together, the instruction might be to rephrase the given sentence using more formal language, correct grammatical structures (like replacing possessive pronouns with the appropriate form when acting as objects), substitute synonyms where possible (especially common phrases), and possibly suggest alternatives like turning negatives into positives by restating suggestions.\n\nBut wait, let's check the first example again: input is \"Please call once you get there.\" Output is \"Please call upon your arrival.\" Here, \"once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival\". So \"once\" is replaced with \"upon\", \"you\" becomes \"your\", \"get there\" becomes \"arrival\". Similarly, \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated\", which is a more formal term. \"We don't think...\" becomes \"It is suggested...\", so changing the voice from first-person opinion to a passive suggestion. The fourth example changes \"I met\" to \"whom I met\", which is replacing the subjective \"I\" with the objective \"whom\" in the relative clause. \n\nAnother example: \"She looks like her sister.\" becomes \"She resembles her sister.\" So \"looks like\" is replaced with \"resembles\", which is a more formal synonym. \n\nSo possible instruction: Take each input sentence and rephrase it using more formal vocabulary, possibly rephrasing certain phrases, correcting grammar (like replacing possessives when they function as objects), restructuring sentences into passive or suggested alternatives when appropriate, and replacing common phrases with their more formal equivalents.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to translate the input into more formal English, which includes both vocabulary substitutions and grammatical corrections. For example, using \"upon\" instead of \"once\", \"entire\" instead of \"whole\", changing \"made up\" to \"fabricated\", replacing \"doesn't think\" with \"is suggested\", and adjusting pronoun cases where needed (like \"my\" to \"whom\").\n\nBut let's see if there's another angle. For instance, the fourth input's change from \"my\" to \"whom\" could be part of a broader instruction about avoiding first-person pronouns in certain contexts, but that doesn't fit the other examples. The third example changes the sentence from a negative (\"not a good idea\") to a positive suggestion (\"no action should be taken\"), which seems like rephrasing to present alternatives rather than stating negatives. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more positive or suggested form, replacing negative statements with positive recommendations, and also applying grammatical and vocabulary upgrades.\n\nPutting all this together, the instruction likely asks the user to take each input sentence and rephrase it using more formal or professional language, making structural changes as needed, replacing certain phrases with synonyms, correcting grammatical errors (like pronoun case), and converting negatives into positive suggestions where applicable. The examples show that this involves a mix of vocabulary substitution, grammatical correction, and rephrasing sentence structures.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to the friend was to **rephrase each input sentence using more formal vocabulary and grammatically correct structures**, while also converting negative statements into positive suggestions. Specifically:\n\n1. **Vocabulary Substitution**: Replace informal expressions with their formal counterparts (e.g., \"once → upon,\" \"whole → entire,\" \"made up → fabricated,\" \"looks like → resembles\").\n2. **Grammatical Corrections**: Adjust pronoun cases (e.g., \"my → your,\" \"my → whom\") to adhere to object-pronoun rules, particularly when the pronoun acts as an object within a clause.\n3. **Structural Revisions**: Transform negative statements into positive recommendations by restating opinions as passive suggestions (e.g., \"we don’t think → it is suggested,\" \"shouldn’t do anything → no action should be taken\").\n4. **Synonym Replacement**: Substitute common phrases with more precise synonyms (e.g., \"helpful → was helpful\" remains unchanged here, but other inputs like \"made up\" to \"fabricated\").\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nThe instruction was to \"Rephrase each input using formal language, correct grammar (especially pronoun cases), convert negatives to positive suggestions, and replace idiomatic phrases with more formal equivalents.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The friend took five different inputs and transformed each into outputs following some rule. My job is to reverse-engineer the original instruction based on these examples. Hmm, let's start by looking at each pair and see what common transformations they might represent.\n\nFirst, let's list the inputs and outputs again to compare:\n\n1. Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n2. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n3. Input: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n4. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n5. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\nLooking at the first example: The original statement expresses a negative opinion (\"don't think it's a good idea\") and suggests inaction. The output is a more formal and polite rephrasing using \"It is suggested that...\" and changing \"do anything\" to \"take no action\". Maybe the instruction is about converting casual or negative statements into more polite or professional-sounding suggestions?\n\nSecond input: The question \"Do you want me to...\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" So here, a question starting with \"Do you want me...\" is transformed into a suggestion phrased as \"Shall I...\", which is more formal and less direct. The subject-verb structure changes from \"Do you...\" to \"Shall I...\" but also removes the personal pronoun \"me\".\n\nThird input: An informal greeting (\"See you tonight.\") is turned into a more formal expression of anticipation (\"I look forward to...\"). So perhaps replacing casual expressions with more formal, positive alternatives that convey eagerness.\n\nFourth input: The adjective \"made up\" is changed to \"fabricated\". That's a direct synonym substitution. So maybe the task involves replacing certain words with their synonyms to make the sentence more precise or formal?\n\nFifth input: The input uses a relative clause \"who I met\", and the output adds \"whom\", which is the objective case instead of the nominative \"who\". So this could be a rule about using the correct relative pronoun based on grammatical case.\n\nPutting all these together, there seem to be multiple possible rules. Let's break them down by category:\n\n1. Politeness/Phrasing:\n   - The first input's negative statement becomes a polite suggestion.\n   - Second example transforms a casual offer into a formal request for accompaniment.\n\n2. Formality:\n   - Third input turns a casual meet-up into a formal expression of looking forward.\n\n3. Synonym Replacement:\n   - Fourth example replaces \"made up\" with \"fabricated\".\n\n4. Grammatical Correctness:\n   - Fifth example changes \"who\" to \"whom\" based on the clause's function.\n\nBut how does one instruction cover all these? Alternatively, maybe each input falls under a specific transformation, and the instruction is a combination of these. But the problem states that there was a single instruction. So perhaps the instruction is a set of instructions, but the user only provided one. Wait, the original problem says: \"The instruction was...\" followed by the options. So the instruction must be a single process that can explain all these outputs from the inputs.\n\nLet's consider possible instruction types:\n\nA. Changing the sentence structure to be more polite or formal.\nB. Replacing specific words with synonyms or more precise terms.\nC. Adjusting grammar (like pronoun cases).\nD. Replacing informal expressions with formal ones.\n\nBut since all examples are covered under different aspects, maybe the instruction is a mix of these. However, perhaps the key is that each output corresponds to replacing the original statement with a more formal version. For instance:\n\n- In the first example, the negative is turned into a positive suggestion.\n- The second example's question is turned into a more formal imperative.\n- The third example uses \"look forward to\" instead of the casual \"see you\".\n- The fourth uses \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up\".\n- The fifth adjusts the relative pronoun.\n\nWait, but \"made up\" and \"fabricated\" are similar in meaning, so maybe the instruction is to replace \"made up\" with \"fabricated\" in some contexts. But why only in the fourth example? Maybe not. Let's check if that's the case. \"Fabricated\" is a synonym for \"made up\" (in the sense of invented), but the fourth input is a general statement, while others might not have a direct synonym replacement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to make the sentence more formal by replacing certain phrases or using different structures. Let's look at each example again with that lens:\n\n1. Original negative + inaction → Suggestive formal phrase.\n2. Casual offer (\"Do you want\") → Formal suggestion (\"Shall I\").\n3. Informal greeting → Formal anticipation.\n4. \"Made up\" → \"Fabricated\" (same meaning, just more formal).\n5. Use correct relative pronoun (\"whom\" instead of \"who\").\n\nHmm, the fifth one is grammatical. So perhaps the instruction has two parts: one that deals with formalizing the language (making it more polite, changing phrasing, synonyms) and another that handles grammar (relative pronouns). But how to combine these into a single instruction?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version, possibly making grammatical adjustments where necessary. But the fifth example specifically requires changing \"who\" to \"whom\", which is a grammatical correction rather than formality. So perhaps the instruction includes both formality improvements and grammatical corrections.\n\nBut the user's outputs for each input vary: some involve synonyms (fourth), some phrasing (first, second, third), some grammatical correction (fifth), and one is a direct synonym replacement (fourth). So maybe the instruction is a combination of tasks: rephrase to a more formal tone, adjust verb forms, change punctuation, etc.\n\nBut how to formulate a single instruction that encompasses all these changes? Let's think of possible instruction prompts that could lead to these outputs.\n\nOne possible instruction is: \"Rewrite the sentence to make it more formal and polite, replacing contractions where appropriate, adjusting the structure for clarity, and ensuring correct grammatical usage (e.g., subject-verb agreement, pronoun cases).\" \n\nLooking at the examples:\n\n1. Input uses a contraction \"don't\"; output expands it to \"is suggested\" which might not directly relate. Wait, the original input is a negative statement, and the output turns it into a positive suggestion. Maybe the instruction is to convert negative suggestions into positive recommendations. For example, turning \"Don't do X\" into \"It is recommended that you shouldn't X\" but in the first example, the output is \"no action should be taken at this stage,\" which is more of a general advice rather than a direct opposite of \"don't.\"\n\nAlternatively, the first input is saying \"we don't think it's a good idea to do anything now.\" The output is \"no action should be taken at this stage.\" So maybe the instruction is to rephrase into a recommendation phrased as a suggestion or advice.\n\nFor the second input: \"Do you want me to...\" is turned into \"Shall I...\" which is a more formal way of offering assistance. So the instruction could be to convert offers of help into polite requests phrased as \"shall I\" instead of \"do you want me.\"\n\nThird example: \"See you tonight\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you.\" So replacing casual greetings with formal expressions of anticipation.\n\nFourth: \"made up\" replaced with \"fabricated.\" Maybe the instruction is to replace colloquial expressions with more formal terms.\n\nFifth: \"who\" changed to \"whom.\" So correct grammatical usage.\n\nBut how to combine these into a single instruction. Maybe the overall instruction is to transform the input into a more formal, polite version, adjusting grammar and vocabulary where needed. Each example falls under this category.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is specific to changing certain phrases or words. For example, changing \"do you want\" to \"shall I,\" replacing \"made up\" with \"fabricated,\" adjusting contractions or negative phrases into positive suggestions, etc. But without seeing the actual instruction prompt, we need to infer based on the outputs.\n\nAnother angle: the outputs often start with certain phrases like \"It is suggested,\" \"Shall I,\" \"I look forward to,\" etc. These are examples of how the input sentences are being restructured into more formal phrasing. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite version by restructuring the sentence, replacing certain words or phrases, and using appropriate conjunctions or auxiliary verbs.\n\nAlternatively, considering that some outputs use \"it is suggested,\" which is a common way to turn advice into a passive voice suggestion. So maybe the instruction involved rephrasing negative opinions or hesitations into positive recommendations using such phrasing.\n\nBut then the third input's output doesn't fit that pattern. Let's see:\n\nOriginal: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n\nThis is a question turned into a suggestion using \"shall I,\" which is part of forming a polite request. So maybe the instruction is to transform questions asking for permission or help into polite requests phrased as \"shall I...\" or \"may I...\".\n\nThe fifth input's output uses \"whom,\" indicating that the instruction included correcting the relative pronoun based on its function in the sentence.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was a combination of several tasks:\n\n1. Convert yes/no questions into polite suggestions using \"shall I\" or similar.\n2. Replace contractions with their expanded forms or more formal alternatives.\n3. Adjust phrasing to be more formal (e.g., changing \"don't think it's a good idea\" to a suggestion).\n4. Replace informal expressions with more formal equivalents (e.g., \"made up\" to \"fabricated\").\n5. Correct grammatical errors, like using \"whom\" instead of \"who\" when required.\n\nBut how to write a single instruction that encompasses all these?\n\nLooking back at the outputs, many of them start with certain key phrases. For example, the first output starts with \"It is suggested that,\" the second with \"Shall I,\" the third with \"I look forward to,\" the fourth is a synonym replacement, and the fifth corrects the pronoun. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal version, possibly using specific phrasing like starting with \"It is suggested that\" or \"Shall I,\" or replacing \"who\" with \"whom,\" etc.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to make the sentence more polite by using more formal language, which could involve changing certain verbs or phrases. For example, \"Do you want...\" to \"May I...\" but in the example given, it's \"Shall I...\". So perhaps the instruction specifies to use \"shall I\" for offers.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to rephrase each input into a more formal version by replacing certain key phrases, like changing \"do you want\" to \"shall I\" or \"may I,\" or replacing contractions, or using more precise wording.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have asked to make the sentence more formal by removing contractions, changing phrasing, using more precise adjectives (like \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up\"), and adjusting grammar (like \"whom\" vs. \"who\").\n\nBut how to determine which instruction would produce all these outputs. Let's hypothesize possible instructions and see which fits best.\n\nHypothesis 1: The instruction was to rewrite each input into a more formal and polite version by replacing certain phrases. For example:\n\n- Replace \"don't think it's a good idea\" with \"It is suggested that...\" or similar.\n- Change \"do you want me to...\" into \"shall I...\"\n- Turn \"see you\" into a formal anticipation expression.\n- Replace \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\"\n- Correct the relative pronoun from \"who\" to \"whom.\"\n\nIf the instruction was something along the lines of \"Rewrite each sentence to make it more formal and polite, replacing informal expressions with their formal equivalents, adjusting grammar, and ensuring correct usage of pronouns,\" then all outputs would fit.\n\nBut maybe the instruction was more specific. For example:\n\n\"Rephrase each sentence into a more polite and formal version by starting with 'It is suggested that' when negating a suggestion, changing questions like 'Do you want...' to 'Shall I...', replacing 'made up' with 'fabricated', adjusting contractions, and correcting relative pronouns.\"\n\nAlternatively, another angle: The outputs sometimes have a change in subject-verb structure. For example, \"do you want me to go\" becomes \"shall I accompany you.\" So changing from passive voice to active (\"you\" to \"I\"), or changing from negative to positive. But the first input goes from negative to positive.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction was to rephrase the input into a recommendation or advice, which is what the first output does. The second example turns a question into a suggestion. The third example turns a greeting into an expression of eagerness. The fourth is a synonym replacement. The fifth corrects the pronoun.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to take the input and convert it into a formal recommendation or advice, adjusting grammar as needed. But why the varied outputs? Unless the instruction had multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each output seems to fit a different type of transformation, but all under the umbrella of making the sentence more formal and polite. So the overall instruction was something like: \"Convert each input into a more formal and polite statement, adjusting grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure as necessary.\"\n\nBut to verify, let's check if all outputs follow this general instruction.\n\nFirst example: Input is a negative statement; output is a positive suggestion. So yes, more formal and polite.\n\nSecond example: Input is a question; output is a polite suggestion. So formal and polite.\n\nThird example: Greeting becomes an expression of anticipation—more formal.\n\nFourth example: Word replacement with a synonym.\n\nFifth example: Grammatical correction of relative pronoun.\n\nSo the fifth example might not fit unless the instruction also mentioned correcting grammar. Therefore, the instruction likely had multiple components: formalizing the language, using proper grammar, replacing words with synonyms, etc.\n\nBut how to write a single instruction that encompasses all these aspects. The most probable instruction would be to rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version, adjusting grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure as needed. Each output corresponds to applying different aspects of this general instruction.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been specific to each example, but since it's a single instruction, it's more likely a general guideline. Hence, the answer is that the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version, possibly involving synonyms, grammatical corrections, and restructuring sentences into polite suggestions or requests.\n\nBut looking at the options given in the problem (assuming it's a multiple-choice or selection from possible answers), but since the user hasn't provided options, we need to deduce based on the examples.\n\nIn many such transformation problems, the key is to find the common element across all examples. Here, the common thread is that each output is a more formal, polite version of the input. Let's verify each example against this hypothesis:\n\n1. \"We don't think...\" becomes \"It is suggested...\" — formal and polite.\n2. \"Do you want...\" becomes \"Shall I...\" — formal and polite.\n3. \"See you...\" becomes \"I look forward to...\" — formal.\n4. \"Made up\" → \"Fabricated\" — more formal.\n5. \"Who I met\" → \"Whom I met\" — grammatical correction.\n\nThus, the fifth example requires a grammatical adjustment, which suggests that the instruction included not only formalization but also correcting grammatical mistakes. Therefore, the instruction likely combined formalizing the language with correcting specific grammatical issues.\n\nBut how to phrase that. The most encompassing instruction would be: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal and polite version, adjusting grammar and vocabulary as necessary.\" This would account for all examples:\n\n- Formalizing phrasing (1,2,3),\n- Word replacement (4),\n- Grammatical correction (5).\n\nTherefore, the instruction was likely: \"Rephrase each sentence into a more formal and polite style, adjusting grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure as needed.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version**, adjusting grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure as needed. Here's how each example aligns with this instruction:\n\n1. **Input**: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\"  \n   **Output**: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"  \n   *Formalization*: Converts a negative suggestion into a polite recommendation phrased with \"suggested\" and \"no action.\"\n\n2. **Input**: \"Do you want me to go with you?\"  \n   **Output**: \"Shall I accompany you?\"  \n   *Politeness*: Transforms a casual offer into a formal request using \"shall I.\"\n\n3. **Input**: \"See you tonight.\"  \n   **Output**: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"  \n   *Formalization*: Replaces a casual greeting with a formal expression of anticipation.\n\n4. **Input**: \"The whole story was made up.\"  \n   **Output**: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"  \n   *Vocabulary*: Substitutes the colloquial \"made up\" with the more formal \"fabricated.\"\n\n5. **Input**: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"  \n   **Output**: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"  \n   *Grammar*: Corrects the relative pronoun from \"who\" (incorrect, as \"whom\" follows the verb \"met\") to \"whom.\"\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version**, adjusting grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure as needed. The outputs demonstrate this by converting informal statements into polite suggestions, adjusting phrasing for formality, replacing words with synonyms, and correcting grammatical elements.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

Hmm, looking at all these input-output pairs, I need to find a pattern or rule that transforms each input into the corresponding output. Let me break them down one by one.\n\nFirst pair: Input \"Thanks for your help.\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" So here, the original sentence starts with \"Thanks for your...\" and the output turns it around to \"Your assistance...\" with \"is much appreciated.\" Maybe the instruction involves restructuring the sentence to make it more formal or polite? Like turning gratitude into appreciation by rephrasing \"help\" as \"assistance\" and changing the structure.\n\nSecond input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" Here, the question is about wanting to go along, and the output uses \"Shall I...\" which is a more formal or older-fashioned way of asking for permission or offering assistance. The subject \"me\" in the input becomes \"I\" in the output, and \"accompany\" replaces \"go with.\" So maybe the instruction is to convert questions about accompaniment into suggestions using \"Shall I...\" and adjusting verbs accordingly.\n\nThird input: \"See you tonight.\" Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" The original is a casual greeting, and the output turns it into a more formal response expressing anticipation. \"See you\" becomes \"look forward to meeting,\" keeping the time reference but making it more about looking forward rather than just a simple greeting.\n\nFourth input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Here, the verb changes from \"stand\" to \"tolerate.\" The rest of the sentence structure remains similar. So perhaps the instruction is to replace certain action verbs (like 'can't stand') with their synonyms or related phrases while keeping the rest of the sentence intact.\n\nFifth input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" The original is informal, and the output is a more direct statement of understanding. So maybe the instruction involves rephrasing informal expressions of comprehension into more straightforward statements like \"I understood.\"\n\nNow, putting all these transformations together, what's the common thread? Let's see:\n\n1. Formalizing gratitude (thanks to appreciating).\n2. Reframing questions about accompaniment into offers using \"shall I.\"\n3. Transforming casual greetings into expressions of anticipation.\n4. Changing negative reactions (can't stand) to alternatives (cannot tolerate).\n5. Converting informal understandings into direct statements.\n\nPossible instruction could involve rewriting sentences to be more formal, polite, or indirect. Let's test this hypothesis against all examples.\n\nFor example, if the instruction was \"Reword the given statement into a more formal and polite expression,\" does that fit all cases?\n\nLet's check each input:\n\n1. Original is a gratitude, rephrased formally. Yes.\n2. The input is a question seeking permission to accompany, rephrased as a polite offer. Yes.\n3. A casual \"see you\" becomes a more formal anticipation. Yes.\n4. \"Can't stand\" is changed to \"cannot tolerate,\" more formal. Yes.\n5. \"Got what you said\" becomes \"understood you,\" more direct and formal. Yes.\n\nAnother angle: The outputs often use more elevated language (assistance vs. help, tolerate vs. stand). So maybe the instruction was to replace certain words or phrases with their more formal synonyms or rephrase the entire sentence to sound more polite and less direct.\n\nAlternatively, could it be about transforming questions into indirect requests? Like replacing \"do you want\" with \"shall I.\" But the first example isn't a question, so that might not be the case. Wait, the second example is a question, and the output is a suggestion. So perhaps the instruction is to turn any request for accompaniment into a formalized offer using \"Shall I...\"\n\nBut then why doesn't the first example fall into that category? The first output isn't a question but a statement. Hmm. So maybe there's another pattern here.\n\nWait, the first input is a statement expressing gratitude, transformed into a more formal acknowledgment. The second is a question turned into an offer. The third is a greeting converted into anticipation. The fourth is a negative reaction rephrased. The fifth is an informal understanding made clearer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to \"Rephrase the given sentence into a more formal and polite tone by adjusting the verbs and sentence structure as follows:\"\n\nBut how exactly? Let's think of possible verbs that are replaced:\n\n- \"got what you said\" → \"understood\"\n- \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\"\n- \"see you\" → \"look forward to meeting\"\n- \"do you want me to go\" → \"shall I accompany you\"\n- \"thanks for your help\" → \"your assistance is much appreciated\"\n\nSo maybe the instruction involved specific transformations based on certain keywords. For example, when the input contains \"can't stand,\" replace with \"cannot tolerate\"; when the input has \"see you,\" change to \"look forward to meeting you.\" Similarly, \"do you want me to go\" becomes \"shall I accompany you,\" and \"thanks for your help\" becomes \"your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n\nBut why would some of the examples require more extensive restructuring? Like the gratitude example versus the question about accompaniment. Maybe the instruction was to apply different rules based on the type of input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was more general: \"Convert each input into a more polite and formal version by rewording the sentence appropriately.\" In that case, each input is processed according to the most suitable transformation for its context.\n\nLooking back at all examples, the outputs seem to be more formal, polite, or indirect versions of the inputs. For instance:\n\n- Gratitude (\"Thanks\") becomes a more elaborate expression of appreciation.\n- Questions about accompaniment become polite offers.\n- Greetings become anticipatory statements.\n- Negative reactions are rephrased for formality.\n- Statements of understanding become more direct.\n\nSo the instruction likely instructs to rephrase each input into a more formal and polite response by adjusting vocabulary and sentence structure. This aligns with the examples provided.\n\nAnother way to phrase the instruction could be: \"Generate a polite and formal restatement of each input, emphasizing respect and formality through word choice and sentence structure adjustments.\"\n\nAlternatively, breaking it down into steps:\n\n1. Identify key phrases or words needing rephrasing (e.g., \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\").\n2. Adjust sentence structure to make it more indirect or polite (e.g., changing questions to offers like \"Shall I...\").\n3. Replace casual expressions with more formal equivalents (e.g., \"see you\" to \"look forward to meeting you\").\n\nYes, this seems to fit all the examples. Therefore, the original instruction probably was to rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version, ensuring that the response is polite, respectful, and uses appropriate vocabulary (e.g., \"assistance\" instead of \"help,\" \"tolerate\" instead of \"stand,\" etc.).\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe original instruction was: **\"Rewrite each input into a formal and polite response, adjusting verb choices, sentence structure, and phrasing to enhance politeness and formality.\"** \n\n### Key Transformations Explained:\n1. **Gratitude (\"Thanks for your help.\") → Formal Acknowledgment**  \n   - Replaced \"help\" with \"assistance,\" and restructured to emphasize appreciation.\n\n2. **Question About Accompaniment → Polite Offer**  \n   - Shifted from a direct question (\"Do you want me to...\") to a formal offer (\"Shall I...\"), altering subject (\"me\" → \"I\") and verb (\"go\" → \"accompany\").\n\n3. **Casual Greeting → Anticipatory Statement**  \n   - Rewrote \"See you\" as \"look forward to meeting you,\" retaining the time reference but softening the tone.\n\n4. **Negative Reaction → Formal Alternatives**  \n   - Substituted \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\" for politeness and formality.\n\n5. **Informal Understanding → Direct Statement**  \n   - Expressed comprehension as a clear assertion (\"I understood you\") instead of the original phrasing.\n\nThis instruction systematically transformed each input into a more respectful, professional, and linguistically elevated output.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

Hmm, the user gave me five input-output pairs where each output seems to be a slightly adjusted or paraphrased version of the input. My job is to determine the general rule or instruction that the friend followed to generate these outputs from the inputs.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at each pair and see if I can spot a pattern. Let's list them again:\n\n1. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n   - So here, the friend changed \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion.\" Maybe they're making it more formal or using a more indirect way of stating their belief?\n\n2. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n   - The friend changed \"can't tell\" to \"find it hard to,\" which is a more formal expression. Also, \"distinguish\" instead of \"tell the difference.\"\n\n3. Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n   - Here, the input is negative (\"don't think it's a good idea\") and the output is more of a suggestion to not take action. The structure changed significantly. Instead of first-person plural, it's a passive or third-person statement with \"is suggested.\"\n\n4. Input: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\n   - The original is colloquial slang (\"fire\"), and the output uses a more standard adjective with an intensifier. \"Incredibly good\" is a more formal version of \"fire.\"\n\n5. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n   - Similar change in phrasing. \"Can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate,\" which is a more formal way of expressing dislike.\n\nLooking at all these examples, there's a pattern of replacing informal or conversational expressions with more formal or standard English phrasing. Let's break down the possible components of the instruction.\n\nPossible instruction components:\n- Replace informal contractions (like \"can't\" to \"cannot\")\n- Use more formal synonyms or phrases\n- Change sentence structure (e.g., passive voice, subject changes from first person to third)\n- Replace idiomatic expressions with more literal or direct equivalents\n\nNow, considering each input-output pair:\n\n1. Original: \"I think...\" → Output uses \"It is my opinion...\" So perhaps the instruction was to convert subjective statements into more objective or formal phrasing. Alternatively, rephrase \"think\" as a longer phrase.\n\n2. Original: \"can't tell\" → \"find it hard to distinguish.\" So replacing \"can't\" with \"find it hard to\" and changing the verb to \"distinguish.\" Maybe the instruction is to avoid contractions and use more descriptive verb phrases.\n\n3. Original: \"We don't think...\" → Output is about suggesting inaction. So perhaps the instruction involved changing the perspective from first person to passive/second person, but here it's even more removed (\"it is suggested\"). Also, the negation turned into a positive suggestion (not do anything vs. suggest no action). Not sure about the exact instruction here.\n\n4. Slang \"fire\" → \"incredibly good.\" So replacing informal slang with a more standard adjective with intensifier. Maybe the instruction is to replace informal terms with more polite or universally acceptable expressions.\n\n5. \"Can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate.\" Replacing slang with a less emotive but equally negative phrase. Maybe the instruction was to avoid contractions and use more formal verbs.\n\nPutting this together, the instruction likely asks the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal or standard English version, avoiding contractions, slang, and colloquial expressions. Additionally, some examples show structural changes like shifting from first-person to third-person, but that might be a secondary effect rather than the main focus.\n\nWait, but looking at example 3: the input is \"We don't think...\" and output is \"It is suggested...\" which is a big structural change. That suggests that the instruction might require transforming the entire sentence structure rather than just replacing words. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to take the input and recast it into a more formal tone, possibly using different sentence structures and avoiding contractions, slang, etc. For example, replacing \"don't\" with \"do not,\" changing to past tense if needed, using more formal synonyms.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, many use \"it is [adjective]\" or similar structures. For instance, \"It is my opinion,\" \"It is suggested,\" \"It is my opinion,\" \"This song is incredibly good.\" So maybe the instruction was to frame the input as a statement starting with \"It is...\" which captures the core idea in a more neutral, formal way. But not all outputs start with \"It is...\" like the third example: \"It is suggested...\" which is still similar but uses \"suggested\" instead.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to take the input and express it in a way that's more assertive or less personal. For example, turning \"I think\" into \"It is my opinion\" might be part of that.\n\nBut the third example is more complex. The original is \"We don't think...\" and the output is a suggestion. So perhaps the instruction requires rephrasing the original statement into a more passive, authoritative suggestion.\n\nSo, combining all these observations, the instruction probably was something along the lines of: \"Take each input and rephrase it into a formal, professional-sounding statement, avoiding contractions, slang, and colloquialisms, and present it in a more assertive or neutral tone.\"\n\nLet me check if that works for all examples.\n\n1. Original: \"I think...\" → Formal rephrase using \"my opinion.\"\n2. \"can't tell\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\" (formal)\n3. \"We don't think...\" → \"It is suggested...\" (suggestion instead of negative opinion; formal)\n4. \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\" (replacing slang with standard)\n5. \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" (formal phrasing)\n\nYes, this seems to fit. The key elements are avoiding contractions, replacing slang, using more formal language, and restructuring sentences to sound more authoritative or neutral.\n\nTherefore, the instruction was likely: \"Rewrite each sentence in a formal style, avoiding contractions, slang, and colloquial expressions. Use more assertive or neutral phrasing and replace informal terms with more standard alternatives.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction given to your friend was to rephrase each input into a **formal, professional-sounding statement** by adhering to the following guidelines:\n\n### Key Components of the Instruction:\n1. **Avoid Contractions**: Replace informal contractions (e.g., \"can't,\" \"don’t\") with their expanded forms (e.g., \"cannot,\" \"do not\").\n2. **Eliminate Slang and Colloquialisms**: Replace casual terms (e.g., \"fire,\" \"can't stand\") with standard, universally understood alternatives (e.g., \"incredibly good,\" \"cannot tolerate\").\n3. **Use Neutral, Assertive Phrasing**: Shift from subjective or first-person perspectives to objective or authoritative statements (e.g., \"It is my opinion...\" vs. \"I think...\").\n4. **Reframe Suggestions/Meanings**: Transform negative/nonspecific opinions into clearer, actionable recommendations (e.g., \"no action should be taken\" instead of \"we don’t think it’s a good idea\").\n\n### Example Application:\n- **Input**: \"I can’t stand his temper.\"  \n  **Output**: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"  \n  *Rule*: Replace slang with formal synonyms while avoiding emotive language.\n\n- **Input**: \"We don’t think it’s a good idea...\"  \n  **Output**: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"  \n  *Rule*: Convert negative opinions into clear, actionable suggestions using third-person structure.\n\n- **Input**: \"This song is fire.\"  \n  **Output**: \"This song is incredibly good.\"  \n  *Rule*: Replace slang with a standard, intensified adjective.\n\nBy systematically applying these rules, the friend transformed informal, conversational inputs into polished, professional outputs tailored to formal contexts.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs.\nHere are the input-output pairs:\n\nInput: The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful. \nOutput: The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\n\nInput: Do you want me to go with you?\nOutput: Shall I accompany you?\n\nInput: This song is fire.\nOutput: This song is incredibly good.\n\nInput: The whole story was made up.\nOutput: The entire story was fabricated.\n\nInput: I can't tell the difference between these two.\nOutput: I find it hard to distinguish between them.\n\nThe instruction was<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<|begin_of_thought|>Okay, let's try to figure out what the instruction was that led to these input-output pairs. So, I have five examples here, each with an input and an output. My job is to determine what general rule or transformation the original instruction was giving. Let me start by looking at each pair and see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nFirst, looking at the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nOutput: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nHmm, the output seems to have changed \"me\" to \"whom\". Wait, but in the original sentence, after the noun \"lawyer\", there's no object. The phrase \"I met yesterday\" is part of the relative clause modifying \"lawyer\". So maybe this isn't about the relative clause at all. Wait, the original sentence is \"the lawyer I met yesterday...\". Since \"I met\" is the verb here, the clause is \"I [verb] the lawyer\". But the output replaces \"me\" with \"whom\", but there's no \"me\" in the input. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original input says \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Oh! So the change is from \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". So the instruction might be to replace the subject pronoun \"I\" with the relative pronoun \"whom\" in such contexts? Wait, but in this case, \"I met\" is part of a relative clause. Let me parse it. The structure is \"The lawyer [that/who/whom] I met yesterday...\". So perhaps the original instruction was to convert personal pronouns into their relative pronoun equivalents when used as the object of a verb in a relative clause. So in the original input, the person didn't use \"whom\", so the instruction was to change \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". That makes sense here because \"met\" is the verb, and \"I\" is the subject of that clause, making it the object in the main clause's relative clause. So replacing \"I\" with \"whom\".\n\nNow the second example:\nInput: \"Do you want me to go with you?\"\nOutput: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\nSo here, the input uses \"me\" and \"you\" in a question, and the output changes those to \"I\" and restructures the sentence to a more formal question using \"shall\" and \"accompany\". So perhaps the instruction was to convert the first-person object pronoun \"me\" to the subject pronoun \"I\" and rephrase the sentence in a more formal or polite way. Also, changing the verb structure (\"want me to go\") into \"shall I accompany you\". So maybe the instruction was to rephrase first-person questions into more polite forms with \"shall\" and change \"me\" to \"I\".\n\nThird input-output pair:\nInput: \"This song is fire.\"\nOutput: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\nSo here, \"fire\" is slang meaning great, so the output is replacing the informal slang with a more descriptive adjective. Maybe the instruction was to replace informal expressions (like slang) with more formal synonyms. Alternatively, maybe expand the term into its literal meaning. But \"fire\" could mean energetic, so \"incredibly good\" is a more descriptive version.\n\nFourth input-output pair:\nInput: \"The whole story was made up.\"\nOutput: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\nSo here, the output replaces \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\". So perhaps the instruction was to replace common phrases with their more formal or precise counterparts. \"Whole story\" vs \"entire story\" (same word, maybe a different usage?), and \"made up\" (meaning created) replaced with \"fabricated\". So maybe the instruction was to replace certain common collocations with their more formal terms.\n\nFifth input-output pair:\nInput: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\"\nOutput: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\nAgain, replacing the informal \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish\". So similar to the third example, replacing idiomatic expressions with more formal or precise phrasing.\n\nNow, putting all these together, the instruction seems to involve rephrasing the inputs in a more formal or polite manner, possibly expanding informal expressions, replacing pronouns, and converting common phrases into more precise terms. However, looking at the first example, the change from \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" suggests that it's specifically about replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" in certain clauses. But in the other examples, the transformations are different. Let's check if that's consistent.\n\nIn the second input, replacing \"me\" with \"I\", which aligns with the first example's change. The third example uses \"fire\" to \"incredibly good\"—so that's a different type of replacement. Fourth: \"whole\" becomes \"entire\", \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated\". Fifth: \"can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish\". So it's a mix of different transformations.\n\nBut maybe the underlying instruction is to replace informal or colloquial expressions with more formal or precise alternatives, and also correct pronoun usage. But the first example seems specific to changing \"I\" to \"whom\" in relative clauses where the subject is mentioned. Let's verify that.\n\nIn the first example, the input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, \"I met\" is the verb phrase in the relative clause. The clause \"I met yesterday\" functions as a past participle phrase modifying \"lawyer\". The relative pronoun would be \"who\" or \"whom\". In standard grammar, when the relative clause is after the noun (i.e., non-defining), the relative pronoun should be \"who\" if it's the subject, \"whom\" if it's the object. But here, \"I met\" is the verb, so \"me\" is the object. However, in the original input, they used \"I met\", which is the subject form. So the output changes \"I met\" to \"whom I met\", which makes \"whom\" the object of \"met\". So perhaps the instruction was to ensure that the relative clause correctly uses \"whom\" when the subject is mentioned.\n\nWait, but in the original input, the structure is \"The lawyer [relative clause] was helpful.\" The relative clause is \"I met yesterday\". Since \"I\" is the subject of \"met\", the relative pronoun should be \"who\" or \"whom\". But in English, the use of \"whom\" in such cases is considered outdated or incorrect in many contexts. However, if the input was written with \"me\", that's an error, and the output corrects it to \"whom\". So perhaps the instruction was to correct the use of \"I/me\" in relative clauses to their proper relative pronouns. For example, replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met\" in such clauses.\n\nIf that's the case, then the instruction is about grammatical correctness in relative clauses, ensuring that the relative pronoun is \"whom\" when referring back to a subject. So the input sentences had errors in the relative clauses where \"I\" was used instead of \"whom\", and the instruction was to correct that.\n\nLooking at the second example, the input is a question: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" The output is a more formal question with \"Shall I accompany you?\" So here, \"me\" is replaced with \"I\", and the sentence structure is adjusted. So maybe the instruction includes correcting pronoun case in both subject and object forms, and rephrasing the question into a more formal construction with \"shall\".\n\nThird example: \"This song is fire.\" becomes \"This song is incredibly good.\" Here, replacing slang \"fire\" with a more descriptive adjective. So perhaps the instruction is to replace informal expressions with more formal or precise equivalents.\n\nFourth example: \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Again, replacing parts of the sentence with more precise terms. \"Whole\" and \"made up\" are both replaced.\n\nFifth example: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" So replacing an informal expression with a more formal alternative.\n\nPutting all this together, the instruction likely involves correcting grammatical errors in pronoun usage (especially in relative clauses), rephrasing informal or colloquial expressions into more formal or precise language, and adjusting sentence structures for politeness or formality.\n\nBut wait, the first example's correction is about the relative pronoun \"whom\". If the instruction was specifically about correcting the use of \"whom\" in relative clauses where the subject is referred, then that would fit. The second example is about correcting \"me\" to \"I\" and restructuring the question. The third to fifth examples are about replacing informal expressions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the first-person singular into third-person, but the outputs don't show that. For example, input \"I want...\" to \"He wants...\", but the outputs here don't have that. The outputs here are different forms.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the instruction was to transform each input into a passive voice. Let's check:\n\nFirst input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Passivized would be \"The lawyer was helpful by me.\" Doesn't match the output. Second input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Passive would be \"Are you wanted to go with me?\" Not matching. Third: \"This song is fire.\" → Passive would be \"The song is being fire by someone.\" No. Fourth: \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The story was made up by someone.\" The output is \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Which is not passive. Fifth: \"I can't tell the difference...\" → Passive would be \"The differences are told by me.\" No. So passive voice doesn't fit.\n\nWhat about changing reported speech? First input is a statement, output is a statement. Second input is a question, output is a question. Third to fifth are statements. So that's not it.\n\nMaybe it's about transforming the sentence structure, like changing questions to statements or vice versa. But second input is a question turned into a statement, others are statements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the first-person singular (\"I\") into second-person (\"you\"), but the outputs don't do that.\n\nLooking back at the first example: changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". So perhaps the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in certain clauses. Let's consider that possibility. If the input has a clause where \"I\" is the subject, then we should change it to \"whom\". But in standard grammar, \"whom\" is typically used as the object. So in the relative clause \"I met yesterday\", \"I\" is the subject, so the relative pronoun should be \"who\" or \"that\". The original input might have been incorrect, using \"I\" where \"who\" or \"that\" should be. But the output uses \"whom\", which is less common unless the sentence is structured in a way that \"whom\" is the object.\n\nWait, the original input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The clause \"I met yesterday\" is a past participle phrase modifying \"lawyer\". The relative pronoun here is \"who\" or \"that\". So the correct relative pronoun would be \"who\" if it's the subject of the relative clause. But if the sentence is \"The lawyer who I met yesterday was helpful,\" that's grammatically correct. However, in the output, it's \"whom I met\", making \"whom\" the object of \"met\", so the structure is \"The lawyer [relative clause] was helpful.\" The relative clause here is \"whom I met yesterday\". So \"whom\" is the object of the preposition implied in the relative clause. Wait, in relative clauses following a noun, if the clause starts with \"that/who/whom\", then depending on whether the clause is the subject or object. If the noun is the subject of the main clause, the relative pronoun can be \"who\" or \"that\". If the noun is the object of a verb, then the relative pronoun must be \"that\" or \"which\" (if non-personal). But in this case, the relative clause is modifying \"lawyer\", which is the subject of the main clause. So \"who\" should be used. But in the output, \"whom\" is used. Hmm, maybe the original instruction was to correct the use of \"I\" in such relative clauses to \"whom\"? But that seems counterintuitive because usually \"I\" is the subject. Maybe the input had an error where \"I\" was mistakenly used as the object, but in reality, the clause is the subject. Wait, the structure here is \"The lawyer [that/who/whom] I met yesterday...\". If the clause is the subject of the main clause, then \"who\" is correct. If the clause is the object of a verb, then \"whom\" is needed. But in this case, the clause is \"I met yesterday\" which is the past participle phrase modifying \"lawyer\", acting as an adjective phrase. The main verb is \"was\". So the clause is a past participle phrase functioning as an adjective, modifying \"lawyer\". Therefore, the relative pronoun should be \"who\" or \"that\". So changing \"I\" to \"whom\" would be incorrect. Unless there's a misunderstanding of the clause structure. Wait, maybe the original sentence is meant to have the relative clause as a dependent clause after the noun, but if the noun is the subject of the main clause, then \"who\" is correct. So why does the output change \"I\" to \"whom\"?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the first-person pronoun \"I\" to \"me\" in such contexts. But that doesn't align with the first example. The output in the first example replaces \"I met\" with \"whom I met\", which is a shift from subject to object case, but in the context of a relative clause, \"whom\" would be the object. But if the noun \"lawyer\" is the subject of the main clause, the relative clause should have \"who\" as the subject. So perhaps the input had a mistake where \"I\" was incorrectly used in the relative clause as the subject, leading to the correction to \"who\" or \"that\", but the output uses \"whom\", which is still incorrect. This seems contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to always use \"whom\" in relative clauses, regardless of its role. That doesn't make sense grammatically. In standard English, \"whom\" is used when the pronoun is the object of the verb in the relative clause. So if the relative clause is acting as a complement to a verb (like \"say\", \"ask\"), then \"whom\" is correct. For example, \"She said that she met the man whom I met yesterday.\" Here, \"whom\" is the object of \"met\". But in the given example, the relative clause is modifying \"lawyer\" as an adjective, not serving as an object. So \"who\" is correct.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that perhaps the initial analysis is wrong. Maybe the first example's output isn't about grammatical correctness but about another transformation. Let me re-examine the first input-output pair again.\n\nOriginal input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nOutput: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\nSo the only difference is the substitution of \"I\" with \"whom\" in the relative clause. But why? Unless the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in certain contexts. Maybe the context is that the noun (lawyer) is the subject of the main clause, so the relative clause should use \"who\". But the output uses \"whom\", which is the object form. That would be grammatically incorrect unless \"met\" is the verb and \"whom\" is the direct object. But \"I\" is the subject of \"met\", so \"whom\" is not the object. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace \"I met\" with \"whom I met\" in any relative clause, regardless of grammatical correctness. For example, changing the subject \"I\" to the object form \"whom\" even when it's not grammatically required. That seems unlikely, as it would lead to errors in other cases.\n\nLet me think differently. Perhaps the instruction was to convert the entire first-person pronoun \"I\" into \"me\" in any context. But in the first example, the output is \"whom I met\", which is \"me\" in object form but with \"whom\". So that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"me\" when it's the object of a preposition. For example, in \"I met him\", if it's \"him\", but that's not the case here. Wait, the original input doesn't have a preposition. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to rephrase the entire sentence into a different structure. For example, changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" might be part of a larger rephrasing, but the other examples don't follow that pattern.\n\nAnother approach: look for common phrases or transformations across all inputs. Let's list them:\n\n1. Input: \"I met\" → Output: \"whom I met\"\n2. Input: \"me to go with you\" → \"accompany you\"\n3. Input: \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\"\n4. Input: \"whole story was made up\" → \"entire story was fabricated\"\n5. Input: \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\"\n\nNoticing that some of these are about replacing informal words/phrases with more formal ones (fire, whole, made up), others are about changing pronouns or rephrasing questions. The second example is about restructuring a question with \"shall\" and changing \"me\" to \"I\".\n\nPerhaps the instruction is to convert the first-person into second-person, but looking at the outputs, there's no clear evidence of that. The first output remains third-person.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a different language or dialect. But the outputs don't seem to indicate that.\n\nWait, looking at the first output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" The structure is maintained except for the \"I\" to \"whom\". If the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"me\" in all cases, but that's not happening here. Or maybe replace \"I\" with \"myself\", but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to insert the relative pronoun in such relative clauses where it's missing. But the original input already has \"I met\", which is a pronoun. Not sure.\n\nWait, another angle: maybe the instruction was to transform the sentences into different tenses or moods. Let's check:\n\nFirst input: present simple → output same tense.\nSecond input: question → output same question structure, just more formal.\nThird input: statement → output same.\nFourth input: past continuous? → output past simple.\nFifth input: present tense → output present tense.\n\nNo change in tense.

The user provided five input-output pairs, and we need to determine the general rule or transformation that connects each input to its corresponding output. Let's start by analyzing each pair one by one to see if there's a pattern.\n\nFirst, looking at the first pair:\nInput: Please call once you get there.\nOutput: Please call upon your arrival.\nHmm, here \"once you get there\" has been changed to \"upon your arrival\". So \"once\" might be replacing \"upon\" here? Or maybe \"get there\" is being rephrased as \"arrival\". Alternatively, could it be a case of converting the time clause into a more formal expression?\n\nSecond input:\nInput: Do you want me to go with you?\nOutput: Shall I accompany you?\nHere, \"Do you want me to...\" becomes \"Shall I...\". This seems like a shift from informal (\"do you want\") to a more polite question form (\"shall I\"). The action \"go with you\" is changed to \"accompany you\", which is a synonym but perhaps a more elevated choice. Also, the structure changes: \"want me to\" becomes \"Shall I\".\n\nThird input:\nInput: Thanks for your help.\nOutput: Your assistance is much appreciated.\nThis transforms a simple \"thanks\" into a longer phrase. \"Thanks for your help\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" The subject shifts from \"help\" to \"assistance\", and the structure becomes a complete sentence expressing gratitude more formally.\n\nFourth input:\nInput: The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\nOutput: The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\nHere, \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\", so the reflexive pronoun \"me\" is replaced with \"whom\" for a more formal tone, using the objective case in a relative clause. This change suggests moving towards more formal or traditional grammar rules.\n\nFifth input:\nInput: The whole story was made up.\nOutput: The entire story was fabricated.\nThis is a direct translation of \"whole\" to \"entire\" and \"made up\" to \"fabricated\". So substituting synonyms for common phrases to make the language more formal or precise.\n\nNow, considering all these transformations, there's a mix of different patterns. Let's categorize them:\n\n1. Changing casual phrasing to formal/more polite: e.g., \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\", \"do you want\" → \"shall I\", \"thanks\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated\".\n2. Referring to people using more formal pronouns: \"me to\" → \"accompany you\" (no pronoun change here), but in the fourth input, \"whom\" instead of \"me\".\n3. Replacing common collocations with more formal equivalents: \"was made up\" → \"was fabricated\", \"helpful\" → \"helpful\" (wait, the output here uses \"was helpful\" same as input; maybe that's not a pattern). Wait, fifth input is substituting \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\". \n\nLooking back, the fourth input doesn't fit the substitution pattern, but the others do. So maybe the main instruction is to make the sentences more formal, but not all substitutions are the same. For example, some might involve changing verb forms, others noun phrases, etc.\n\nAnother angle: Check if the outputs have any common elements not present in the inputs. For instance, the second input's output adds \"Shall I\", which wasn't there before. The third adds \"is much appreciated\". The first adds \"upon your arrival\". The fourth adds \"whom\". The fifth replaces \"whole\" with \"entire\".\n\nWait, perhaps the overall instruction is to convert the given sentence into a more formal version, but there's variation in how each is done. Let's look for a unifying theme.\n\nIn the first input, \"once you get there\" is transformed into \"upon your arrival\". Both are about the point of time, but using \"upon\" and \"arrival\" might be part of a formal style. Similarly, the second input uses \"Shall I\" which is a polite way to ask for permission. The third uses a longer, more elaborate expression of thanks. The fourth uses \"whom\" which is more formal than \"me\". The fifth substitutes \"entire\" for \"whole\" and \"fabricated\" for \"made up\".\n\nSo maybe the general instruction is to rewrite each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly by replacing certain words or phrases with their more formal counterparts, adjusting pronouns, using more elevated vocabulary, or restructuring the sentence for politeness or formality.\n\nAlternatively, looking at each output compared to input, the outputs seem to be instances of making the language more formal, often using older English constructions like \"upon your arrival\", \"shall I\", \"Your assistance is much appreciated\". The fourth input's \"whom\" is another example of archaic pronoun usage in modern contexts. The fifth input replaces \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\"—these are synonyms, but perhaps chosen based on connotations or more formal register.\n\nSo the instruction might be: \"Rewrite the input sentence into a more formal version, using appropriate polite forms, elevated vocabulary, and adhering to traditional grammatical structures when possible.\"\n\nBut let's verify if this holds for all examples.\n\nTake the second input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" Here, \"do you want me\" is replaced with \"Shall I\", which is a formal way to seek permission or offer to do something. \"accompany you\" is a synonym for \"go with you\", but phrased more formally.\n\nThe third input: \"Thanks for your help\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" This shifts the focus from the act of helping (\"your help\") to the quality of that help (\"assistance... is much appreciated\"), making it more specific and formal.\n\nThe first input's transformation uses \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"once you get there\". Both mean the same, but \"upon arrival\" sounds more formal.\n\nFourth input's use of \"whom\" instead of \"me\" is a more traditional pronoun, even though in modern English, \"me\" is acceptable. But here, it's used in the relative clause \"whom I met\", maintaining the object case after the verb.\n\nFifth input replaces \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\". Both are synonyms, but \"entire\" is more formal than \"whole\", and \"fabricated\" has a slightly stronger connotation than \"made up\" in the context of stories.\n\nTherefore, the underlying instruction is to formalize the language by employing polite expressions, elevated vocabulary, traditional grammatical structures (like \"whom\"), and more formal synonyms where applicable. The goal seems to be making the original request or statement more courteous, precise, and aligned with traditional English usage rather than modern colloquialisms.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version**, utilizing elevated vocabulary, traditional grammatical structures (e.g., \"whom\" instead of \"me\"), and polite expressions. The key transformations include:\n\n1. **Polite Polysyllabic Alternatives**: Replace informal phrases with more formal equivalents (e.g., \"call upon your arrival\" vs. \"call once you get there\").\n2. **Archaic/Traditional Grammatical Structures**: Use older pronouns (e.g., \"Shall I accompany you?\" instead of \"Do you want me to...\").\n3. **Elevated Vocabulary**: Substitute common terms with their formal counterparts (e.g., \"entire\" for \"whole,\" \"fabricated\" for \"made up\").\n4. **Extended Gratitude Phrasing**: Transform concise thanks into more elaborate expressions of appreciation (e.g., \"Your assistance is much appreciated\").\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe instruction was to formalize the language by converting each input into a more polite, elevated, and traditionally structured expression.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs.\nHere are the input-output pairs:\n\nInput: This song is fire.\nOutput: This song is incredibly good.\n\nInput: I can't stand his temper.\nOutput: I cannot tolerate his temper.\n\nInput: The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful. \nOutput: The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\n\nInput: We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\nOutput: It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\n\nInput: I think that this is interesting.\nOutput: It is my opinion that this is interesting.\n\nThe instruction was<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<|begin_of_thought|>Okay, let's try to figure out what the original instruction could be. The user provided five input-output pairs where their friend transformed each input into the corresponding output. My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction based on these examples. \n\nFirst, I need to look for patterns or commonalities across all the input-output pairs. Let's list them out again:\n\n1. Input: This song is fire.\n   Output: This song is incredibly good.\n\n2. Input: I can't stand his temper.\n   Output: I cannot tolerate his temper.\n\n3. Input: The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\n   Output: The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\n\n4. Input: We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\n   Output: It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\n\n5. Input: I think that this is interesting.\n   Output: It is my opinion that this is interesting.\n\nHmm, let's analyze each pair. For the first one, \"fire\" becomes \"incredibly good.\" So maybe replacing adjectives with more intense or formal synonyms? Or converting informal expressions into more formal ones?\n\nSecond input: \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate.\" Both are negative expressions about enduring something, but phrased differently. Maybe replacing common conversational phrases with more formal equivalents?\n\nThird input: The subject case changed from \"I\" to \"whom\" in the relative clause. So changing the pronoun from subject to object case in certain clauses? But why only here? Let me check. Original: \"...the lawyer I met yesterday...\" Output: \"...the lawyer whom I met yesterday...\". So the \"I\" after \"lawyer\" became \"whom\". That suggests that the instruction might involve modifying relative clauses where the relative pronoun is used as the object of a verb or preposition.\n\nFourth input: The entire sentence structure changes from a statement (\"We don't think\") to a suggestion (\"It is suggested that...\"). The output is phrased using \"it is suggested that,\" which is a formal way of presenting advice. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase statements of doubt or negative opinions into formal suggestions or recommendations.\n\nFifth input: The \"I think that\" structure is replaced with \"It is my opinion that.\" So converting personal opinions into formal statements of one's opinion. That's a common way to present subjective thoughts formally.\n\nPutting all these together, there might be multiple aspects of the instruction. Let's see if there's a common thread.\n\n1. Formalizing language: Converting casual expressions into more formal ones. For example, \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate,\" \"This song is fire\" (casual) to \"incredibly good\" (formal/superlative). \n\n2. Changing sentence structure: The third input shows a shift from \"I met\" to \"whom I met,\" which seems like converting a subject pronoun to an object case in a relative clause. Similarly, the fifth input changes \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion.\"\n\n3. Redefining suggestions or opinions: The fourth input turns a negative thought into a formal recommendation. The first input's output uses a superlative, which is a form of emphasis.\n\nWait, the first output \"incredibly good\" isn't exactly a synonym; it's a more emphatic version. So maybe the instruction is to enhance the expression of opinion by making it more intense or formal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input is a statement expressing an opinion, and the output is a more formal restatement. For instance, \"I think that\" becomes \"It is my opinion that,\" which is a common way to frame subjective statements formally. The first input's output uses \"is incredibly good,\" which could be seen as a more intense way of expressing approval. The fourth input's output is a suggestion, which aligns with turning a negative opinion into a positive suggestion.\n\nBut then, why does the third input change \"I met\" to \"whom I met\"? That's a grammatical adjustment. The original input uses the subject form \"I met,\" but the output uses \"whom\" as the object of the relative clause \"met.\" So maybe the instruction involves restructuring clauses where the relative pronoun is the object, requiring the use of \"whom.\"\n\nLooking back at the third input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the \"I\" in \"I met\" becomes \"whom.\" That's the object of the verb \"met.\" So in such cases, the subject pronoun \"I\" becomes \"whom.\"\n\nSimilarly, in the fifth input: \"I think that this is interesting\" becomes \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" So \"I think\" is replaced with \"It is my opinion.\"\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is twofold: First, when someone expresses an opinion (using \"I think\"), convert it into a formal statement using \"It is my opinion that.\" Second, when there's a relative clause where the relative pronoun is the object (like \"the lawyer whom I met\"), adjust the pronoun accordingly. Additionally, maybe other transformations like intensifying adjectives or converting casual expressions into more formal terms.\n\nLet's check the second input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" The structure is similar, just changing \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate.\" Both are negative expressions, but \"tolerate\" is more formal than \"stand.\"\n\nThe first input: \"This song is fire\" → \"This song is incredibly good.\" So \"fire\" is colloquial, replaced with \"incredibly good,\" which is more emphatic.\n\nSo combining all these observations, the possible instruction is: \"For each input, convert informal or conversational expressions into more formal, grammatically correct language. Specifically, replace common conversational phrases with their formal equivalents, adjust pronoun cases in relative clauses, and rephrase opinions using more formal structures like 'It is my opinion that' instead of 'I think.'\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another pattern. Let's look at the outputs again:\n\n1. Input informal → output formal.\n2. Changed \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate.\"\n3. Changed \"I met\" to \"whom I met.\"\n4. Changed \"We don't think\" to \"It is suggested...\"\n5. Changed \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion...\"\n\nAnother possibility: The instruction is to rephrase each input into a formal recommendation or suggestion, especially when expressing negative opinions. For example, turning \"We don't think it's a good idea\" into \"It is suggested...\" which is a formal way of suggesting an action.\n\nAdditionally, the third input's transformation involves changing \"I\" to \"whom\" in the relative clause, which is a grammatical adjustment. So maybe the instruction includes fixing pronoun cases in certain relative clauses.\n\nMoreover, the fourth input's output uses \"no action should be taken,\" which is a stronger recommendation than the original \"it's not a good idea.\"\n\nSo putting this all together, the instruction likely requires the following transformations:\n\n- When expressing an opinion (like \"I think\"), rephrase it as \"It is my opinion that\" or similar.\n- Replace informal expressions like \"can't stand\" with more formal alternatives (\"cannot tolerate\").\n- Convert informal adjectives (\"fire\") into more emphatic or formal versions (\"incredibly good\").\n- Adjust pronoun cases in relative clauses where the relative pronoun is the object (e.g., \"I met\" → \"whom I met\").\n- Turn statements of negativity or lack of ideas into formal suggestions or recommendations.\n\nBut how to formulate this into a single instruction? The user probably said something like, \"Rewrite each sentence to make it more formal, replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents, adjusting pronoun cases in relative clauses, and transforming statements of doubt into formal recommendations.\" However, looking back at the outputs, the fifth input's output is not just \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion,\" but also the structure is changed. Wait, no—the fifth input is \"I think that this is interesting\" becoming \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" So it's not just replacing \"I think\" but also adding \"my opinion.\" But perhaps the actual instruction is more focused on the transformation of the entire sentence structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was specifically to convert each input into a formal, grammatically correct version by making several specific changes, such as adjusting pronoun cases, replacing certain phrases with formal equivalents, and rephrasing opinions.\n\nGiven that the user provided five pairs, each requiring different adjustments, the instruction must encompass a range of transformations. However, looking for the common thread among all outputs, perhaps the key is to convert each input into a more formal and grammatically precise statement. For example:\n\nOriginal instruction: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal, grammatically correct sentence by adjusting pronoun cases in relative clauses, replacing informal expressions with their formal equivalents, and rephrasing statements of opinion into a formal structure.\"\n\nBut let's test this hypothesis against the examples.\n\nTake the first input: \"This song is fire.\" The output is \"This song is incredibly good.\" Here, \"fire\" (colloquial) is replaced with \"incredibly good,\" which is a more emphatic form. So the instruction includes enhancing the expression by using more intense adjectives or phrases.\n\nThe second input: \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate.\" Both are negative expressions, but \"tolerate\" is more formal. So replacing informal phrasing with formal terms.\n\nThird input: \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met.\" Adjusting pronoun case in a relative clause.\n\nFourth input: The entire sentence is transformed into a suggestion. The original is \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" The output is \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" So here, the instruction includes rephrasing doubts into formal recommendations.\n\nFifth input: \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion.\" Again, turning a first-person opinion into a third-person formal statement.\n\nSo combining all these, the instruction likely requires three main steps:\n\n1. Replace informal or colloquial expressions with their more formal counterparts.\n2. Adjust pronoun cases in relative clauses where the relative pronoun is the object.\n3. Rephrase statements of opinion or uncertainty into formal recommendations or declarations of fact.\n\nTherefore, the instruction given to the friend was something like: \"For each input, convert it into a more formal and grammatically precise sentence by replacing informal expressions with their formal equivalents, adjusting pronoun cases in relative clauses, and rephrasing statements of opinion or doubt into formal recommendations or declarative statements.\"\n\nTo confirm, let's check if this fits all the examples:\n\n1. \"This song is fire\" → \"incredibly good\" (formal equivalent).\n2. \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" (formal).\n3. \"I met\" → \"whom I met\" (pronoun case adjustment).\n4. \"We don't think\" → \"It is suggested...\" (rephrasing doubt into a recommendation).\n5. \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion...\" (changing first-person to formal).\n\nYes, this seems to cover all the transformations. Therefore, the instruction was likely focused on formalizing the language through various grammatical and lexical adjustments.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction given to your friend was to **reformat each input into a more formal and precise version** by applying the following transformations:\n\n1. **Replace Informal Expressions**: Convert casual or colloquial phrases (e.g., \"can't stand\") into their formal equivalents (e.g., \"cannot tolerate\").\n2. **Adjust Pronouns in Relative Clauses**: Modify subject pronouns to their object forms (e.g., \"I met\" → \"whom I met\") when they serve as the object of verbs or prepositions.\n3. **Rephrase Opinions/Suggestions**: Transform statements of uncertainty or negative opinions into formal recommendations or declarative statements of fact (e.g., \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion...\").\n\n### Final Instruction:\n\"Refine each input by formalizing language, replacing informal expressions with their more polite equivalents, adjusting pronoun cases in relative clauses, and restructuring opinions/doubts into clear, actionable recommendations.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

Let's start by analyzing each pair to see if there's a pattern or common transformation applied to each input to get the output.\n\nFirst, looking at Input 1: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" and Output 1: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" Hmm. The first output seems like a rephrasing but not a direct translation. Maybe the instruction was to convert questions into more polite requests or something? But wait, the input here isn't a question, it's a question asking for capability. The output turns it into a conditional or a more formal phrasing. Not sure yet.\n\nInput 2: Original is a statement \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Oh, so they changed \"I\" to \"whom\"? Because \"whom\" is the objective case, whereas \"I\" is subjective. So perhaps the instruction was to replace subject pronouns with object pronouns where appropriate? But in the original input, the subject was \"I\", but the output uses \"whom\". Wait, maybe it's changing the case based on grammar rules? Like converting from subject to object case when necessary. Let me check other examples to see if this applies elsewhere.\n\nInput 3: \"I think that this is interesting.\" Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" Here, the output is rephrasing \"I think\" as \"it is my opinion\". So maybe the instruction was to turn personal opinions into statements using \"it is my opinion\" structure. Interesting. Let's check the next input.\n\nInput 4: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" Comparing the outputs, the input uses \"can't tell the difference\", output uses \"find it hard to distinguish\". So it's a different way of expressing the same idea. Possible that the instruction was to rephrase certain phrases into synonyms or alternative expressions.\n\nInput 5: \"See you tonight.\" Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This is converting a casual greeting into a more formal statement of anticipation. So maybe the instruction was to replace casual expressions with more formal or structured responses.\n\nNow, trying to find a common thread here. Each output seems to be a form of rephrasing or restructuring the original input in a specific way. Let's categorize each transformation:\n\n1. For Input 1: Change \"can you\" to \"would you be able to accomplish\", which seems like making a more polite request by rephrasing the question into a conditional or ability statement.\n\n2. For Input 2: Replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in the relative clause. This is converting the subject pronoun to the objective case because \"I met\" is the subject (I is the subject), but in the relative clause \"whom I met\", \"whom\" is the object of \"met\". So maybe the instruction was to correct pronoun cases in sentences.\n\n3. For Input 3: Replace \"I think\" with \"it is my opinion\". This is a specific phrasing change, perhaps part of a larger instruction to rephrase opinions into a more formal tone.\n\n4. For Input 4: Convert \"can't tell the difference\" to \"find it hard to distinguish\". This might involve replacing certain idiomatic expressions with synonymous phrases, perhaps part of a list of such substitutions.\n\n5. For Input 5: Convert a casual greeting (\"See you\") into a formal anticipation (\"I look forward to...\"). This could be about restructuring informal expressions into more professional or expected responses.\n\nNow, considering all these transformations, the instruction could be a combination of multiple tasks. But the problem states that the instruction was a single instruction given to the friend. So the friend applied a set of operations to each input. Let's try to see if there's a common pattern.\n\nLooking at Input 2's transformation: changing \"I\" to \"whom\" in a relative clause. That's a grammatical correction. Input 5 changes a casual greeting into a formal phrase. Inputs 3 and 4 seem to involve rephrasing specific phrases. Input 1's transformation is turning a question into a more formal query. Input 2 is about grammar. The other three are about rephrasing.\n\nWait, maybe the instruction was to make each input more formal or polite? For example, changing the style from conversational to formal. But let's check:\n\nInput 1: Original is a question, output is a conditional statement. If the instruction was to rephrase the original input into a more formal version, how does that apply to all examples?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to replace certain words with synonyms or rephrase entire sentences. Let's see:\n\n- Input 1: Original question → output starts with \"Would you be able...\", which could be considered more formal.\n- Input 3: \"I think...\" → \"It is my opinion...\" which is a way to express the same thing more formally.\n- Input 4: \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\" – same meaning, different phrasing.\n- Input 5: Casual greeting becomes \"look forward to\", which is more formal.\n- Input 2: The output replaces \"I\" with \"whom\" in the relative clause. So if the instruction was to make grammatical corrections (like proper pronoun case), then this fits. But why would \"I met\" become \"whom I met\"? Because in the relative clause \"who/whom I met yesterday\", the antecedent is \"lawyer\". So \"I met the lawyer\" → \"the lawyer whom I met\", maintaining the object case. That's a grammatical correction. So Input 2 is a grammar correction.\n\nSo now we have mixed transformations: some grammar-related (Input 2), some style changes (Inputs 3,4,5,1), and one rephrasing (Input 1). How can these all fit under a single instruction?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to convert the input into a different grammatical structure, such as transforming declarative sentences into questions or vice versa, but Input 1's original is a question, and the output isn't a question. So that might not fit.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, each seems to be a more formal version of the input. For example:\n\n- Input 1: Question → formal statement.\n- Input 2: Grammatical correction (subject vs. object pronoun) to formal.\n- Input 3: Informal \"I think\" → formal \"it is my opinion\".\n- Input 4: Idiomatic expression → more formal phrasing.\n- Input 5: Casual greeting → formal anticipation.\n\nIf the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal style, then this would explain the transformations. But why does Input 2 require changing \"I\" to \"whom\"? Because the original sentence uses \"I\" in the relative clause, which is incorrect. Changing it to \"whom\" makes the pronoun case correct and perhaps also makes it more formal.\n\nSo maybe the instruction was to make the text more formal by correcting grammar (like pronoun case) and rephrasing informal expressions into more standard English.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to convert each input into a specific type of response, like a question into a suggestion, or a statement into an opinion.\n\nBut the problem states that the instruction was a single instruction, and the friend applied it to each input to produce the outputs. So the key is to find what operation transforms each input into the corresponding output across all examples.\n\nLet me try to find a general rule. Let's list each input-output pair again:\n\n1. \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n\nPossible transformations here: changing the interrogative \"can\" to \"would you be able to accomplish\". So maybe replacing \"can\" with \"be able to\" and adjusting the rest.\n\n2. \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\nThis is changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\", indicating a change in pronoun case from subject to object. So perhaps replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" whenever possible.\n\n3. \"I think that this is interesting.\" → \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n\nRephrasing \"I think\" into \"it is my opinion\".\n\n4. \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n\nReplacing \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n\n5. \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n\nConverting casual greeting into a formal expression.\n\nSo each output seems to be a combination of grammar correction (Input 2) and style changes (Inputs 1,3,4,5). But the instruction has to cover all these cases. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to apply a specific transformation to each input based on its content. For example, some transformations were grammar-related, others were stylistic.\n\nBut the problem states that the instruction was a single instruction given to the friend. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version, which would include both grammar corrections and stylistic changes. However, Input 1 is a question, which is rephrased into a conditional statement, which is more formal. Input 5 is a casual greeting turned into a formal statement. Input 2 is a grammatical correction. Inputs 3 and 4 are stylistic rephrasings. So maybe the instruction was to make the input more formal by converting it into a more polite or structured version, which could include both grammar and style changes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace certain phrases with their synonyms or formal equivalents. For example, \"See you\" becomes \"look forward to\", \"I think\" becomes \"it is my opinion\", etc. But why would \"Can you\" become \"Would you be able to\"? That doesn't seem like a direct synonym replacement. Unless it's part of a set of instructions to rephrase queries into more polite forms.\n\nWait, looking back at Input 1: Original is a question asking for capability, output is a conditional statement expressing possibility. So the instruction might have been to rephrase questions into conditional or hypothetical statements. But why does that apply to all inputs? Input 2 isn't a question, it's a statement. So that can't be the sole instruction.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to rephrase each input according to specific rules, but the rules aren't consistent across all examples. That complicates things.\n\nAnother approach: look for common operations in each input-output pair.\n\nFor Input 2: Changing \"I\" to \"whom\". So replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" in a relative clause. This is a grammatical correction. So maybe the instruction was to correct pronoun cases where the subject becomes the object in a clause.\n\nInput 5: Replacing a casual greeting with a formal statement. So maybe the instruction was to respond to greetings with a formal acknowledgment.\n\nInput 3: Converting \"I think\" to \"it is my opinion\". So maybe the instruction was to rephrase first-person opinions into third-person statements using \"it is my opinion\".\n\nInput 4: Replacing \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish\". So maybe the instruction involved replacing specific idiomatic expressions with their synonyms.\n\nInput 1: Turning a question into a conditional statement. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase questions into conditional or polite requests.\n\nBut how do these all fit under a single instruction? Perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version, which could involve various changes depending on the original structure. However, the problem is that Input 2 requires a grammatical correction (changing \"I\" to \"whom\"), while others involve style changes. Unless the overall instruction was to make the text more formal, which would include both grammar corrections and style adjustments.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to apply certain transformations to each input based on its part of speech or sentence structure. But without knowing the exact instruction, it's challenging.\n\nWait, the outputs have a common element: each is a complete sentence that seems to provide a slightly modified version of the input. The instruction could be to \"rephrase each input into a more formal sentence,\" which encompasses both grammatical fixes and stylistic changes. For example:\n\n- Input 1: Formalizing a question into a polite conditional.\n- Input 2: Correcting pronoun case to make it formal.\n- Input 3: Expressing an opinion in a more formal way.\n- Input 4: Replacing an idiom with a synonym.\n- Input 5: Formalizing a casual greeting.\n\nSo the instruction could have been to rephrase each input into a more formal version, possibly combining both grammar corrections and stylistic adjustments. However, the instruction should be a single, concise statement that the friend understood.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, each seems to start with a capital letter and end with a period, but that's probably just the way they're presented here, not part of the instruction.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to convert each input into a question-answer format or some other structured response. For example, Input 1 is a question, output is an answer to that question. But the first input is a question, and the output is similar in structure. However, the other inputs are statements, and their outputs are also statements, so that might not fit.\n\nWait, another observation: the outputs sometimes have additional clauses or phrases. For example, Input 3 adds \"my opinion that\" to \"I think\". Input 5 adds \"I look forward to\" to \"See you\". So maybe the instruction was to add specific phrases or structures to each input.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to apply a series of transformations, such as:\n\n1. Replace \"I\" with \"whom\" where appropriate (as in Input 2).\n2. Convert \"I think\" to \"it is my opinion\" (as in Input 3).\n3. Replace \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish\" (Input 4).\n4. Replace casual greetings with formal alternatives (Input 5).\n5. Rephrase questions into conditional statements (Input 1).\n\nBut how would the instruction encompass all these different changes? Unless the instruction was to apply all these transformations, but that's unlikely as the friend might have done them one by one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a different type of sentence. For example:\n\n- Input 1: Convert to a conditional sentence.\n- Input 2: Convert to a relative clause with proper pronoun case.\n- Input 3: Convert to a statement of opinion.\n- Input 4: Convert to a paraphrase of the difference.\n- Input 5: Convert to a formal greeting response.\n\nBut how to phrase this as a single instruction. It might have been something like \"Rewrite each input into a more formal version, adjusting pronoun cases where necessary, converting statements into opinions when applicable, and replacing idiomatic expressions with formal alternatives.\"\n\nHowever, the problem states that the instruction was given once, and the friend applied it to each input. So the instruction must be a precise, single set of directions that could lead to each of the outputs through application to each input.\n\nAnother approach: consider that each output is generated by applying a specific transformation to the input. For example:\n\n- Input 1: Replace \"can you\" with \"would you be able to accomplish\".\n- Input 2: Replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in the relative clause.\n- Input 3: Replace \"I think\" with \"it is my opinion\".\n- Input 4: Replace \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n- Input 5: Replace \"See you\" with \"I look forward to meeting you\".\n\nIf the instruction was to apply these specific replacements, but that would require a long list of transformations, which is unlikely as the instruction should be concise.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to rephrase each input according to certain rules that are common across all examples. For instance, perhaps the instruction was to make the input more polite or formal by adding certain phrases or restructuring sentences.\n\nBut looking again at Input 2, changing \"I\" to \"whom\" is a specific grammatical correction rather than a politeness or formality change. So perhaps the instruction was more general, like \"correct grammatical errors\" plus \"make the text more formal\".\n\nBut without seeing the actual instruction, it's hard to be certain. However, given the examples, the most plausible instruction would be something along the lines of \"rephrase each input into a more formal version by correcting pronoun cases, replacing informal expressions with their formal equivalents, and restructuring sentences as needed\".\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to convert each input into a response that is both a rephrasing and a formality upgrade. But given the diversity of the outputs, it's challenging to pinpoint exactly.\n\nWait, another thought: the outputs sometimes use \"I\" in certain contexts. For example, Input 3's output starts with \"It is my opinion...\", which uses \"I\" but in the possessive sense. Maybe the instruction was to use \"I\" when appropriate but avoid first-person pronouns in certain cases, but that doesn't align with Output 2.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to rephrase the input into a different kind of sentence. For instance:\n\n- Input 1: The instruction was to convert yes/no questions into conditional statements.\n- Input 2: Convert statements into relative clauses with proper pronoun case.\n- Input 3: Express opinions as statements of belief.\n- Input 4: Rewrite differences as difficulty in distinguishing.\n- Input 5: Greeting into anticipation.\n\nBut this still doesn't form a single instruction.\n\nWait, looking at all outputs:\n\n1. Input 1 becomes a conditional statement (would you be able to accomplish)\n2. Input 2 becomes a relative clause with \"whom\" (grammatical correction)\n3. Input 3 becomes a statement of opinion (\"it is my opinion\")\n4. Input 4 becomes a paraphrase (\"find it hard to distinguish\")\n5. Input 5 becomes a formal greeting response (\"I look forward to\")\n\nThe only common factor among these transformations is that they all seem to involve modifying the input to produce a slightly different but related output. The instruction could have been to transform each input into a version that is more formal or adheres to specific grammatical rules.\n\nConsidering all possibilities, the most comprehensive instruction that covers these transformations would be: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal version by correcting grammatical errors, replacing informal language with more formal alternatives, and reorganizing sentence structures as needed.\"\n\nHowever, the friend applied this instruction to each input, resulting in the outputs provided. Therefore, the instruction was likely aimed at enhancing the formality and correctness of the input, encompassing various linguistic adjustments.\n\nAnother possible instruction could be: \"Convert each input into a more polite and structured response by adjusting pronoun cases, replacing contractions with full phrases, and rephrasing as necessary.\"\n\nGiven that the friend transformed each input using these methods, this would explain the outputs. However, the exact instruction could vary based on the specific adjustments made. Since the problem asks for the instruction, and the examples show both grammatical corrections and stylistic changes, the instruction must encompass both aspects.\n\nIn conclusion, the instruction was likely to rephrase each input into a more formal version by correcting grammatical errors and adjusting language to be more polite or structured, which the friend did for each input accordingly.\n\n<|end_of_th",

Hmm, each input seems to have been transformed into a more formal or polite version of the sentence. Let's look at each example to see if there's a pattern.\n\nStarting with the first pair:\nInput: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\nSo the original uses \"I considered,\" but the output changes it to passive voice, \"Various approaches were considered.\" That suggests the instruction might be to convert active sentences to passive voice. But let's check the others to confirm.\n\nSecond example:\nInput: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\nHere, the output is a more formal expression of the same meaning. Instead of a casual \"See you,\" it becomes a more polite phrase. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase casual greetings into more formal versions.\n\nThird input:\n\"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\nAgain, changing \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate,\" which is more formal. So that supports changing informal expressions to formal equivalents.\n\nFourth:\n\"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\nThe output here replaces slang (\"fire\") with a more standard adjective. So perhaps the instruction is to replace informal slang with more conventional phrasing.\n\nFifth:\n\"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\nChanging the question from a casual form (using \"do you want\") to a more formal or antiquated \"shall I...\" and changing \"go with you\" to \"accompany.\"\n\nPutting all these transformations together, the instruction might be to rewrite each input in a more formal, polite, or traditionally correct manner. Each example seems to involve adjusting vocabulary, sentence structure, or formality level.\n\nWait, but the first example was about passive voice, but the others aren't. The second example was changing the greeting style. So maybe the overall instruction is to rephrase the input in a more formal tone. Let's check the possible answers.\n\nPossible instruction candidates could be:\n\n1. Rewrite each input into a more formal or traditional English version.\n2. Convert all active sentences to passive voice.\n3. Replace informal expressions with more conventional ones.\n4. Use more polite phrasing instead of direct questions/statements.\n\nLooking at all the outputs, the second example shows that casual greetings are turned into more formal expressions. The third example changes \"can't stand\" to \"tolerate,\" which is more formal. The fourth example removes slang. The fifth example changes \"Do you want...\" to \"Shall I...\" which is a formal phrasing. The first example converts \"I considered\" to passive. Wait, but the first output doesn't match passive voice. \"Various approaches were considered\" is passive, but the input is \"I considered...\" So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input in a passive voice? But the first input's output isn't passive. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, first input:\nInput: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\nSo the original sentence uses \"I considered,\" passive voice would be \"Many approaches were considered by me.\" But the output is \"Various approaches were considered,\" which is actually passive voice. But the input was in active voice. So maybe the instruction is to convert active sentences to passive voice. But the second example doesn't fit that. The second input is \"See you tonight,\" output is \"I look forward to meeting you.\" That's not passive voice. So perhaps the instruction is broader than just passive voice. Let's think again.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to rephrase each input into a more formal version. For instance, replacing contractions, using more formal verbs, changing pronouns, etc. Let's check each example under this hypothesis:\n\n1. Original: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Formal could be \"Various approaches were considered.\" (Passive voice)\n2. \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to your acquaintance tomorrow.\" Or maybe \"Your presence is appreciated at our meeting tonight.\" But the given output is \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" Which is a more formal way of saying \"See you,\" but also a bit longer. So perhaps the instruction is to replace casual expressions with more formal or elegant alternatives.\n3. \"I can't stand his temper.\" → \"I cannot endure his temper\" or \"I am unable to tolerate his temper.\" The output is \"I cannot tolerate his temper,\" which is more formal and avoids \"stand.\"\n4. \"This song is fire.\" → \"This song is exceptional.\" Or using adjectives like \"incredibly good,\" which is more formal.\n5. \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\" which is a more formal way of asking for permission.\n\nAnother angle: checking the verb tenses and structures. The first input's output uses past tense passive, second uses present tense, third uses present tense, fourth uses present tense, fifth uses conditional. Not sure. The output verbs don't consistently follow any tense pattern except for the first example. Maybe the instruction is to rewrite each input in a more formal register, using appropriate verb forms, longer phrases, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more polite form. The fifth example clearly does that. The second example also replaces a casual greeting with a more formal one. The third example replaces \"can't stand\" with \"tolerate,\" which is slightly more polite. The fourth example replaces slang with a more conventional expression. The first example uses passive voice, which could be part of making it more formal.\n\nBut why does the first example use passive voice? If the instruction is to make it more formal, perhaps converting to passive is part of that. However, the second example doesn't use passive. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input in a more formal style, which might include passive voice when appropriate, but not exclusively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to use more complex sentence structures, such as passives, formal vocabulary, and avoid contractions. Each output in the examples meets those criteria:\n\n1. Passive voice.\n2. No contraction, longer phrase.\n3. Formal verb (\"tolerate\" instead of \"can't stand\").\n4. No slang, replaced with \"incredibly good.\"\n5. Formal \"Shall I\" instead of casual question.\n\nTherefore, the most likely instruction is: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal or traditionally correct English version, using appropriate vocabulary, grammar, and avoiding contractions or slang.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or traditionally correct English version**, incorporating elements such as:\n\n1. **Passive voice** (e.g., \"Various approaches were considered\" from \"I considered many approaches\").\n2. **Avoidance of contractions** (e.g., \"I look forward to meeting you\" instead of \"See you\").\n3. **Formal vocabulary** (e.g., replacing \"can't stand\" with \"tolerate\" and slang with \"incredibly good\").\n4. **Polite phrasing** (e.g., \"Shall I accompany you?\" instead of \"Do you want me to...\").\n\nBy applying these transformations, the friend generated outputs that reflect a higher degree of formality and elegance compared to the original inputs.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs where each output seems to be a paraphrased version of the input. So, I need to determine what transformation or rewriting rule the friend applied to convert each input into its corresponding output. \n\nFirst, I'll look at each pair individually to see if I can spot any patterns or commonalities.\n\nStarting with the first pair:\nInput: \"The whole story was made up.\" \nOutput: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n\nComparing these two sentences, the main change is replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\". Both replacements seem to maintain the same meaning but use synonyms. \"Whole\" and \"entire\" are often interchangeable when referring to totality. \"Made up\" and \"fabricated\" both mean something was created as false.\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: \"Please call once you get there.\" \nOutput: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n\nAgain, replacing \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\". These phrases both indicate timing—after arriving. \"Upon\" is a synonym for \"once\" in this context. The structure here might also involve rephrasing the prepositional phrase.\n\nThird pair:\nInput: \"I got what you said.\"\nOutput: \"I understood you.\"\n\nHere, \"got what you said\" is transformed into \"understood you\". \"Got\" here means \"understood\" or \"comprehended\". The original sentence is more casual, while the output is more formal or concise. \"Got what you said\" could be a colloquial way of saying \"I understood your statement,\" which is rephrased as \"I understood you.\"\n\nFourth pair:\nInput: \"I think that this is interesting.\"\nOutput: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n\nIn this case, the structure changes from first-person (\"I think\") to a formal \"it is my opinion...\". The content remains the same, just the phrasing is adjusted. This might be about elevating the tone of the statement or converting it into a more formal expression.\n\nFifth pair:\nInput: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\"\nOutput: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n\nSimilarly, the output is a more formal way of expressing the same idea. \"Can't tell the difference\" is rephrased as \"find it hard to distinguish\", which uses a different verb (\"distinguish\" instead of \"tell\") and adds \"it is\" as part of the subject-verb structure.\n\nLooking for common themes across all these transformations:\n\n1. **Formalization**: The outputs often sound more formal than the inputs. For example, using \"entire\" instead of \"whole\", \"upon your arrival\" vs \"once you get there\", \"understood you\" vs \"got what you said\", etc. This suggests the instruction might have been to make the sentence more formal or professional.\n\n2. **Syntactic Changes**: Some outputs change sentence structure. For instance, the fourth input becomes a noun clause starting with \"It is my opinion...\", which is a common formal structure. Similarly, the fifth input's output uses \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n\n3. **Synonym Replacement**: Words like \"made up\" to \"fabricated\", \"can't tell\" to \"find it hard\", \"got\" (as in understand) to \"understood\". Synonyms are used to rephrase without changing the core meaning.\n\n4. **Colloquial to Formal**: The third input's output shifts from a more casual phrasing to a more direct statement. \"Got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you\".\n\nPossible instruction possibilities:\n\n- The instruction was to rewrite the given sentence in a more formal tone.\n- Alternatively, it could be to convert the input into a more standard or grammatically correct form, possibly eliminating contractions or informal expressions.\n- Another possibility is to rephrase using synonyms and/or restructuring sentences into a different syntactic structure.\n\nWait, let's check if any of these transformations involve negation. The first input doesn't seem negative, but maybe some others? The fifth input is about not being able to tell the difference. The output is rephrased similarly but not necessarily negated. The fourth input doesn't have a negative. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to rephrase each sentence into a passive voice? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" – Passive, yes. Original is active. But the first output is passive. Second input: \"Please call upon your arrival\" – active, but output is \"Please call upon your arrival\" – wait, that's the same. Wait, second input's output is the same structure. Third input: \"I understood you\" – same structure as input. Fourth input's output is same structure. Fifth input's output is same structure. So passive isn't the case here.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to make the sentence more formal, using synonyms, changing phrasing, etc., without necessarily changing the grammatical structure much.\n\nAnother angle: Could the outputs be translations from another language? Unlikely, since they don't show linguistic markers of translation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to adjust the sentence for grammar or correctness. Let's check the original inputs for any issues. First input: \"The whole story was made up.\" – grammatically correct. Output is same. Second input: \"Please call once you get there.\" – correct. Output same. Third input: \"I got what you said.\" – correct, though maybe slightly informal. Output: \"I understood you.\" which is more formal. Fourth input: correct. Output same structure. Fifth input: correct. Output same.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to adjust the sentence for formality or style, not grammar. For example, turning casual into more formal, replacing contractions with full forms, etc. But the third input's \"I got what you said\" is replaced with \"I understood you\" which is less casual. However, none of the inputs are clearly casual in the other cases.\n\nWait, the first input is \"The whole story was made up.\" – no contractions. The output is same. The second input is \"Please call once...\" – same as output. Third input has \"got\" which is a contraction (would be \"have got\"). But \"got\" here is present tense, so maybe not a contraction. In any case, the third output replaces \"got what you said\" with \"understood you\", which is more direct.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to convert each sentence into a noun clause. For example, first input becomes \"The fact that the entire story was fabricated\" – but that's not the case here. Outputs are still sentences.\n\nWait, fourth output is \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" – which is a noun clause starting with \"It is...\". So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input as a noun clause, often starting with \"It is my opinion that...\".\n\nBut looking at the third input, output is \"I understood you\" – same structure as input. So that might not fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction was to make the statement more assertive. For example, replacing \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion that\", or replacing \"can't tell\" with \"find it hard\".\n\nBut the first input is \"The whole story was made up.\" and output is same. So perhaps some instructions were more about synonyms and structure than others. But why would the first input's output be the same? Unless the instruction allowed for different approaches. Wait, the first input's output is the same as input. Maybe the instruction wasn't strictly to change every word, but to rephrase as much as possible while maintaining the meaning.\n\nBut then the first input's output is identical. That's odd. Unless the instruction required minimal changes but not forced. But that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to make the output more concise or clear. For example, \"Please call upon your arrival\" removes \"once you\" and adds \"upon\", making it more concise. Similarly, \"I found it hard to distinguish between them\" would be better, but the example uses \"find it hard\".\n\nAnother thought: The outputs might be using more elevated vocabulary. For example, \"fabricated\" over \"made up\", \"arrival\" over \"get there\". This could suggest the instruction was to use more sophisticated vocabulary.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to eliminate any possible ambiguity or rephrase for clarity. For instance, replacing \"got what you said\" with \"understood your statement\" or similar. But the output here is \"I understood you\", which is a bit abrupt compared to the original, but maybe intended to be direct.\n\nLooking back at all the examples:\n\n1. Formality increase.\n2. Synonym replacement.\n3. Structural changes (e.g., removing \"I think\" and using \"my opinion\").\n4. Changing verb phrases (can't tell -> find it hard).\n\nPutting this together, the most likely instruction is to rephrase each sentence into a more formal tone, using synonyms and appropriate structure, possibly eliminating contractions or casual expressions. The key elements would involve making the language more formal, precise, and using more elevated vocabulary.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to convert the sentence into a noun clause starting with \"It is my opinion that...\", but that only applies to one input (fourth). The fifth input's output is similar to that structure but without the \"my opinion\". So that's probably not it.\n\nAnother possibility: The instruction was to translate the sentence into a different style of English, such as removing slang or colloquialisms. For example, \"I got what you said\" is more conversational, whereas \"I understood you\" is more straightforward.\n\nGiven all this, the instruction is likely asking to rephrase the input into a more formal, sophisticated version, possibly using synonyms and restructuring sentences to enhance clarity or formality. The exact instruction might be something along the lines of \"Rewrite each sentence in a more formal style, replacing informal expressions with more polite or precise alternatives.\"\n\nTo verify, if the instruction was to make the sentence more formal, all the outputs align with that. The first input's output is same as input because it's already formal. The second input's output is same structure but more formal phrasing. The third input loses the contraction and uses a more direct statement. The fourth and fifth inputs are rephrased into formal structures.\n\nTherefore, the instruction was likely: \"Rewrite each sentence in a more formal and polished style, using appropriate synonyms and reorganizing sentence structures where necessary.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each sentence into a more formal and polished style**, utilizing synonyms and restructuring sentence elements to enhance clarity or formality. Here’s how this aligns with the input-output pairs:\n\n1. **Formal Vocabulary**: Replace casual terms (e.g., \"whole\" with \"entire\", \"made up\" with \"fabricated\") with synonyms to elevate tone.\n2. **Structural Adjustments**: Restructure phrases like \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\" or eliminate contractions (e.g., \"got what you said\" → \"understood you\").\n3. **Phrasing for Clarity**: Convert expressions into more direct or standardized forms (e.g., \"I think that... → 'It is my opinion that...\", \"can't tell... → \"find it hard to distinguish\").\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nThe instruction was to **rephrase each sentence into a more formal and precise style**, using synonyms and refining sentence structure for clarity or formality.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

So, the friend took each input and transformed it into a specific output. My job is to reverse-engineer what the initial instruction was that would require such transformations.\n\nFirst, let me list out the pairs again to get a clear picture:\n\n1. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n2. Input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n3. Input: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\"\n4. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n5. Input: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n\nHmm. Let me analyze each pair to see if there's a common pattern or rule that connects them. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or different structure?\n\nStarting with the first input-output pair. The original is thanking someone, and the output turns it into a statement that acknowledges their help. So perhaps the instruction is to convert expressions of gratitude into formal compliments or statements of appreciation. But wait, the second input is a question asking ability, and the output rephrases it as \"Would you be able to...\". That seems like changing a present tense \"can\" (which implies capability) into \"be able to\", which is more about potential. Interesting.\n\nThird input: \"I got what you said.\" Output is \"I understood you.\" So the subject changed from \"I\" to \"you\"? Wait, original is \"I got what you said.\" Output is \"I understood you.\" Wait, no. Original is first person, output is also first person but phrased differently. Maybe it's about rephrasing in a more positive or direct way? Or maybe changing pronouns? But in the third example, both are first person. Wait, no: original is \"I got what you said,\" and the output is \"I understood you.\" Wait, the original is from the speaker's perspective (\"I\"), and the output is \"I understood you,\" which could be a rephrasing where the speaker is stating they understood the listener. Not sure yet.\n\nFourth input: \"She looks like her sister.\" Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" So here, the verb \"looks like\" is replaced with \"resembles.\" So maybe the instruction is to replace certain phrases with their synonyms or more formal equivalents.\n\nFifth input: \"Please call once you get there.\" Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\" Here, \"once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival,\" which is a more formal or traditional way of expressing the same idea.\n\nLooking at the verbs used in outputs compared to inputs:\n\n- Thanks → assistance is appreciated (so \"assistance\" is a noun form, and \"appreciated\" is the past participle)\n- Do all these tasks → accomplish (base verb vs base verb + past participle \"able\")\n- Got what you said → understood you (same person but verb \"understood\" vs original \"got\")\nWait, original is \"I got what you said.\" Output is \"I understood you.\" So \"got\" here might be slang or informal for \"received,\" but the output uses \"understood,\" which is more about comprehension rather than receiving information. Hmm, that's an interesting transformation. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase in a way that emphasizes understanding rather than receipt of information.\n\nIn the fourth example, \"looks like\" becomes \"resembles.\" Both are ways to express similarity, but \"resembles\" is more formal. The fifth example turns \"once you get there\" into \"upon your arrival,\" which is a more formal or traditional phrasing.\n\nSo, putting this together, the instruction might involve rephrasing the input into more formal language, replacing idiomatic expressions with their more standard or synonym-based equivalents, or adjusting sentence structure to be more polite or professional.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis against each example:\n\n1. Original: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n   - \"Thanks\" is informal, replaced with a formal expression. \"Assistance\" (noun) + \"is much appreciated\" (passive voice, more formal). So yes, fitting the pattern of formalizing.\n\n2. Original: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n   - \"Can you\" is replaced with \"Would you be able to accomplish.\" \"Can\" is about capability, \"be able to\" is more about potential, and \"accomplish\" is a stronger verb. So formalizing and rephrasing capability.\n\n3. Original: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\"\n   - Changed \"got\" (past tense of 'get') to \"understood\" (past tense of 'understand'), which shifts focus from receiving to comprehending. Also, swapped \"you\" to \"you\" in the output, but maybe the original had a different structure? Wait, the original is \"I got what you said.\" The output is \"I understood you.\" So \"you\" remains the same person, but the action is rephrased from receiving to understanding.\n\n4. Original: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n   - Replaced \"looks like\" (informal) with \"resembles\" (formal synonym). Both are present tense verbs but different in formality and perhaps connotation.\n\n5. Original: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n   - \"Once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival,\" which is a more formal and traditional way to express the same meaning. \"Upon\" introduces a cause or reason, so \"upon your arrival\" means when you arrive, so you should call. This fits the pattern of replacing idiomatic expressions with more formal alternatives.\n\nNow, looking for a general instruction that encompasses all these changes. Let's consider possible instruction phrases:\n\n- Rewrite each input in a more formal tone, using more standard or synonym-based phrasing where appropriate.\n- Replace casual expressions with their more formal or synonym equivalents.\n- Convert questions about capability into phrases expressing ability.\n- Change phrases indicating receipt of information to those expressing understanding.\n- Replace idiomatic expressions with their formal or synonym-based counterparts.\n\nAnother angle: the outputs seem to be more polite or formal. For example, the first output is more formal and less direct than the input. The third input/output change the verb tense and subject-verb structure. The fourth example uses a synonym. The fifth example replaces a colloquial phrase with a more formal one.\n\nWait, the third input/output transformation: \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you.\" So the original is in the present perfect (\"got\"), but the output is \"understood,\" which is simple past. Also, the original is from the speaker's perspective (\"I got\"), but the output is \"I understood you.\" It's possible that the instruction is to rephrase the input into a statement of understanding rather than reporting receipt. That's an interesting transformation.\n\nSo, the instruction might involve converting statements of receipt or capability into statements of understanding or ability. Alternatively, it could be about adjusting the formality level of the sentences.\n\nLooking at the verbs used in outputs:\n\n- \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" (polite)\n- \"Would you be able to\" (polite request)\n- \"I understood you\" (direct but still polite)\n- \"She resembles\" (neutral to formal)\n- \"Please call upon your arrival\" (formal)\n\nAll these are more formal or polite than their inputs. Let's check the inputs:\n\nOriginals are in varying tones:\n- Gratitude (input 1), question (input 2), statement (input 3), observation (input 4), instruction (input 5).\n\nOutputs are generally more formal and polite.\n\nSo, perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal, polite version. However, the third example doesn't fit that if we take \"Got\" as receiving information, but the output shifts to \"understood you,\" which is more about comprehension. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase in terms of understanding rather than receiving.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace specific phrases with their more formal equivalents. For example, \"thanks\" becomes \"assistance appreciated,\" \"can you\" becomes \"would you be able to,\" \"look like\" becomes \"resemble,\" \"call once you get there\" becomes \"call upon your arrival.\"\n\nAnother possibility: the instruction was to transform each input into its antonym or related concept. But that seems less likely, as the transformations don't show antonym patterns.\n\nWait, the first example's output is not the opposite of the input. \"Thanks\" isn't the antonym of anything here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase in passive voice. Let's check:\n\nInput 1: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output is passive. Input 2: \"Can you...\" → Output is passive? No. Input 3: \"I got...\" → Output is passive? No. Input 4: \"She looks like...\" → Output is active. Input 5: \"Please call...\" → Output is same. So passive is only in the first example. So probably not the main pattern.\n\nAnother approach: looking for common verbs or phrases used in outputs. For instance:\n\n- \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" uses \"assistance\" and \"appreciated.\"\n- \"Would you be able to accomplish\" uses \"able to accomplish.\"\n- \"I understood you\" is straightforward.\n- \"She resembles her sister\" uses \"resembles.\"\n- \"Please call upon your arrival\" uses \"upon your arrival.\"\n\nSo the instruction might be telling the friend to replace certain phrases with their synonyms or more formal versions. Let's see:\n\n- \"thanks\" → \"assistance is much appreciated\": \"appreciated\" is the past participle form.\n- \"can you do all these tasks?\" → \"would you be able to accomplish\": \"able\" is an adjective here, forming a modal-like phrase.\n- \"i got what you said\" → \"i understood you\": changing \"got\" to \"understood.\"\n- \"she looks like her sister\" → \"she resembles her sister\": replacing \"looks like\" with \"resembles.\"\n- \"please call once you get there\" → \"please call upon your arrival\": changing \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival.\"\n\nSo, the instruction could be a combination of multiple tasks, such as:\n\n- Convert \"thanks\" to \"appreciation of assistance.\"\n- Replace \"can you\" with \"would you be able to.\"\n- Replace \"got what you said\" with \"understood you.\"\n- Replace \"looks like\" with \"resembles.\"\n- Replace \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival.\"\n\nBut this seems too fragmented. Maybe there's a overarching instruction, like \"Rewrite each input into a more formal or polite version by replacing specific phrases with their synonyms or more formal counterparts.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to replace specific words or phrases with their more formal or synonym-based equivalents, such as:\n\n- \"thanks\" → \"appreciate\"\n- \"can you\" → \"be able to\" + verb\n- \"got\" → \"understood\"\n- \"look like\" → \"resemble\"\n- \"call once you get there\" → \"call upon your arrival\"\n\nBut how to combine all these into a single instruction?\n\nAnother angle: the outputs often end with a period, but the inputs vary. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into its antonym or a more formal version. But as mentioned earlier, that doesn't fit well.\n\nWait, looking at the third input: \"I got what you said\" → output \"I understood you.\" So the transformation is not negation, but a shift from \"got\" (received) to \"understood\" (comprehended). Maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentence to emphasize understanding rather than just receiving information.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to convert the sentence into a statement of gratitude, but only some inputs lead to gratitude. The first input does, but others don't. So that's unlikely.\n\nAnother thought: the outputs are all in the past tense. Let's check:\n\nInput 1: past tense (\"Thanks\"), output is present \"is appreciated.\"\n\nInput 2: present tense (\"Can you\"), output is conditional present \"Would you be able to.\"\n\nInput 3: past perfect (\"got\"), output is simple past \"understood.\"\n\nInput 4: present tense (\"looks\"), output is present \"resembles.\"\n\nInput 5: imperative + past tense (\"call once you get\"), output is present \"call upon.\"\n\nSo tense changes aren't a consistent pattern. Only the first example changes tense.\n\nHmm. So that approach doesn't work.\n\nWait, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version using certain keywords or phrases. For example, \"thanks\" becomes \"appreciation,\" \"can you\" becomes \"would you be able to,\" etc. Let's see:\n\n- \"help\" → \"assistance\"\n- \"can you do\" → \"be able to accomplish\"\n- \"got\" → \"understood\"\n- \"like\" → \"resemble\"\n- \"call once you get there\" → \"call upon your arrival\"\n\nIf that's the case, then the instruction could be something like: \"Replace 'help' with 'assistance,' 'can you do' with 'be able to accomplish,' 'got' with 'understood,' 'like' with 'resemble,' and 'call once you get there' with 'call upon your arrival.'\"\n\nBut this seems very specific to these exact phrases, which might not generalize. However, given the examples, this could be the case. But the problem is that there are other inputs that don't fit into these specific replacements. For example, the second input is \"Can you do all these tasks?\" which gets turned into \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" So the replacement here is not just \"can\" to \"be able to,\" but the entire phrase \"can you do\" becomes \"would you be able to accomplish.\"\n\nThis suggests that the instruction might have been more nuanced. Perhaps the instruction involved replacing certain collocations or structures rather than individual words. For example:\n\n- When the input ends with a question about capability (like \"Can you...\"), rephrase it to \"Would you be able to...\" and adjust the verb accordingly.\n- For \"thanks,\" replace with \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n- For \"got what you said,\" replace with \"understood you.\"\n- For \"looks like,\" replace with \"resembles.\"\n- For \"call once you get there,\" replace with \"call upon your arrival.\"\n\nThis seems possible. So the instruction might have been a series of rules:\n\n1. If the input contains \"can you do,\" rephrase to \"would you be able to accomplish.\"\n2. If the input is an expression of gratitude, rephrase to \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n3. If the input is a statement of understanding via \"got,\" rephrase to \"understood.\"\n4. If the input contains \"looks like,\" replace with \"resembles.\"\n5. If the input is a request to call upon arrival, rephrase with \"upon your arrival.\"\n\nBut this feels quite specific. However, considering that the friend followed this pattern for all inputs, even if some require multiple steps, perhaps the instruction was a set of rules to apply to each input, possibly in order. Alternatively, the instruction might have been a general guideline to rephrase the input into a more formal, polite version using certain transformations.\n\nAnother possible angle: the outputs are all polite requests or statements. The first output is a compliment, the second a polite question, the third a statement of understanding, the fourth a synonym, the fifth a formal request. So the instruction could be to rephrase each input into a more polite or formal version. But how does that account for the specific word replacements?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate each input into its antonym, but as discussed earlier, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, another observation: the output for the second input is \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" which is a longer sentence structure. The original was a short question. So perhaps the instruction is to expand the question into a more elaborate form, but the first input's output is a single sentence, not an expansion. So that might not be it.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to convert the input into a passive voice sentence. Let's check:\n\nInput 1: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output is passive. Input 2: \"Can you do...\" → Output is \"Would you be able to...\" which is not passive. Input 3: \"I got...\" → Output is \"I understood you.\" Not passive. So this is inconsistent.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let's try to see if there's a common element across all outputs. Let's look at the outputs:\n\n1. Your assistance is much appreciated.\n2. Would you be able to accomplish...\n3. I understood you.\n4. She resembles her sister.\n5. Please call upon your arrival.\n\nWhat do these have in common? They are all more formal or polite than the inputs. The outputs tend to use more nouns, adjectives, and formal verb forms. For example:\n\n- Output 1 uses \"assistance\" (noun) and \"appreciated\" (past participle).\n- Output 2 uses \"able\" (adjective) modifying \"to accomplish.\"\n- Output 3 uses \"understood\" (past tense), which is more direct than \"got.\"\n- Output 4 is a synonym for \"look like.\"\n- Output 5 uses a more formal expression \"upon your arrival.\"\n\nPerhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal, standard English version, possibly by replacing colloquialisms with their formal equivalents, adjusting verb forms, or restructuring sentences.\n\nGiven that the friend applied this transformation to all inputs, the most plausible instruction would be along the lines of \"Rewrite each input into a more formal version by replacing specific phrases with their synonyms or more standard phrasing.\" The key would be to identify the specific phrases or structures in each input that were targeted for replacement.\n\nFor example:\n\n- \"Thanks\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n- \"Can you do...\" → \"Would you be able to...\"\n- \"Got\" → \"Understood.\"\n- \"Looks like\" → \"Resembles.\"\n- \"Call once you get there\" → \"Call upon your arrival.\"\n\nThese specific replacements can be seen in the examples. Therefore, the instruction likely included instructions to make these exact substitutions. However, since the user hasn't provided the actual instruction text, the assistant needs to deduce the most probable instruction based on the given data.\n\nConsidering the examples and the transformations, the instruction was probably a set of specific replacement rules for each input. However, since the friend applied the same logic to all inputs, it's possible the instruction was more general, such as \"Transform each input into a more formal, polite version by replacing specific phrases with their synonyms or adjusted forms,\" without listing every possible phrase, but the friend followed a pattern for each case.\n\nAnother possibility is that the instruction was to replace certain collocations or parts of speech. For example:\n\n- Replace \"can you\" with \"would you be able to.\"\n- Replace \"got what you said\" with \"understood.\"\n- Replace \"look like\" with \"resemble.\"\n- Replace \"call once you get there\" with",

So, the user provided five input-output pairs where each input was transformed into a new output. My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction that would generate these outputs from the given inputs.\n\nFirst, I need to look for patterns between each input and output. Let's take each pair one by one and see if I can spot any common transformations.\n\nStarting with the first input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" The output is \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" Hmm, both sentences are about not being able to differentiate something. The output seems to rephrase the input in slightly more formal language. For example, changing \"can't tell\" to \"find it hard to distinguish,\" and keeping the rest similar. Maybe the instruction involves replacing certain phrases or adjusting the sentence structure while maintaining the meaning.\n\nSecond pair: Input is \"The whole story was made up.\" Output is \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Again, similar structure but replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\" That suggests replacing synonyms or parts of speech. Maybe replacing adjectives or nouns here.\n\nThird input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" Here, the question is being rephrased. The original is a simple yes/no question (\"Can you...\"), and the output turns it into a more polite question (\"Would you be able to...\"). Also, \"do tasks\" becomes \"accomplish all these tasks.\" So perhaps the instruction involves restructuring questions, changing some verbs, and making them more polite.\n\nFourth input: \"Please call once you get there.\" Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\" This changes \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival.\" Both mean arriving, but different prepositions and word choices. The output uses more formal phrasing (\"call upon\") instead of the casual \"call once.\"\n\nFifth input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" Here, the original statement expressing a negative opinion is turned into a positive suggestion (\"it is suggested\") and a more formal structure with \"should be taken.\" The original idea is reversed in terms of tone (from \"don't think it's a good idea\" to \"suggested to not take action\").\n\nNow, looking for common elements in all these transformations. Each input is being rephrased in a more formal, perhaps even opposite or restructured way. Let's categorize the types of changes:\n\n1. **Vocabulary replacement**: Changing words like \"difference\" to \"distinguish,\" \"made up\" to \"fabricated,\" etc.\n2. **Structural changes**: Rewriting questions, changing sentence types (e.g., from command to suggestion), adjusting prepositions (like \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival\").\n3. **Reversal of sentiment**: Like changing a negative opinion (\"don't think it's a good idea\") into a positive suggestion (\"no action should be taken\").\n4. **Grammatical adjustments**: Converting from informal to formal structures, like using \"I find it hard\" instead of \"I can't tell,\" or changing \"should be taken\" to a passive voice.\n\nNow, thinking about possible instructions that could encompass all these changes. The key might be that each output is a more formal, polite version of the input, possibly inverted in some cases (like the last example where the original negative is turned into a suggestion). However, looking at the third input's transformation, the question is changed into a more polite form. The fourth example changes the timing expression. The fifth example flips the sentiment entirely.\n\nBut wait, maybe the instruction is about taking the input and generating an output that either reverses the sentiment, rephrases it formally, or both. Alternatively, maybe it's about converting certain expressions into their more formal equivalents. For instance, replacing contractions (if any) with full forms, but the examples here don't have contractions.\n\nLooking again at the third input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" becomes \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" So \"can\" is replaced with \"would be able to,\" and the verb \"do\" becomes \"accomplish.\" So here, the instruction might involve restructuring the sentence to make it more formal and polite, perhaps by adding conditional clauses or changing the verb tense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a more formal, possibly inverted or rephrased statement. Let me consider possible instruction phrases that could lead to such transformations.\n\nPossible candidates for the instruction:\n\n- Convert each input into a more formal, polite version of the statement.\n- Restructure each input sentence into a more formal alternative, preserving the core meaning.\n- Invert the sentiment or adjust the perspective (like turning a negative into a positive suggestion).\n- Replace specific phrases with their synonyms or more formal counterparts.\n- Convert direct questions into indirect or more polite questions.\n- Adjust the prepositional phrases or temporal expressions (like \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival\").\n\nGiven that the outputs vary widely, perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal version, possibly including different sentence structures, vocabulary, and even reversing the logic in some cases (like the fifth input). However, not all inputs are logically reversed; the third input is just a rephrasing of a question into a more polite form without changing the logic.\n\nAnother angle: The outputs sometimes use the passive voice (e.g., \"no action should be taken\"), whereas the inputs often use active (\"we don't think it's a good idea\"). Similarly, the second input's \"fabricated\" is a synonym for \"made up.\" The first input's \"distinguish between\" comes from \"tell the difference between.\" The fourth input's \"your arrival\" vs. \"you get there.\"\n\nSo, the instruction might involve taking the input and replacing certain words or phrases with their synonyms or more formal equivalents, adjusting the sentence structure (like passive vs. active), changing the type of sentence (declarative to conditional, question to suggestion), or adjusting prepositions and temporal expressions.\n\nPutting this together, the most comprehensive instruction that covers all these transformations might be something along the lines of: \"For each input, rephrase it into a more formal, polite version, using appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure, and possibly adjusting the sentiment or perspective as needed.\"\n\nBut let me test this hypothesis against the examples:\n\n1. Input: \"I can't tell the difference...\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish...\" Formal rephrasing, same structure. The instruction matches here.\n2. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Same structure, replacing \"whole\" with \"entire,\" \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\" Instruction fits.\n3. Input: \"Can you do...\" → Output: \"Would you be able to...\" Here, the instruction would involve restructuring the question into a more polite form. The instruction about rephrasing into a formal version includes this.\n4. Input: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\" Changed the prepositional phrase from \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival.\" The instruction allows for adjusting prepositions and time expressions.\n5. Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea...\" → Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken...\" Here, the original negative is transformed into a suggestion, and the structure changes. The instruction about adjusting sentiment or perspective would account for this.\n\nTherefore, the instruction likely required transforming each input into a more formal version, possibly adjusting sentence structure, vocabulary, and even the overall sentiment. The key components of the instruction are:\n\n- Rephrasing in a more formal tone.\n- Adjusting vocabulary (synonyms, parts of speech).\n- Changing sentence structures (questions into suggestions, etc.).\n- Modifying prepositional phrases and temporal expressions.\n- Possibly inverting sentiment or perspective in some cases.\n\nTo phrase this concisely, the instruction might have been: \"For each input, rephrase it into a more formal, polite version using appropriate vocabulary, sentence structure, and adjusting the perspective or sentiment as necessary.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was: **\"For each input, rephrase it into a more formal, polite version using appropriate vocabulary, sentence structure, and adjusting the perspective or sentiment as necessary.\"**  \n\nThis instruction encompasses the following key transformations:\n1. **Formality Adjustment**: Replace informal expressions (e.g., \"can't tell\" → \"find it hard\") and use more formal synonyms (e.g., \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up\").\n2. **Structural Changes**: Restructure sentences (e.g., questions → suggestions, direct commands → polite requests), adjust sentence types (declarative → conditional), and refine prepositional/temporal phrases (e.g., \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"once you get there\").\n3. **Sentiment Reversal**: Flip perspectives when necessary (e.g., \"don’t think it’s a good idea\" → \"suggested to take no action\").\n4. **Vocabulary Replacement**: Substitute words for synonyms or more formal alternatives while preserving meaning.\n\nEach output pair demonstrates adherence to this instruction through tailored adjustments in tone, structure, and wording.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

So, the user provided five input-output pairs, and we need to determine what transformation or rule the friend applied to each input to get the corresponding output. Let me start by analyzing each pair carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\nHmm. \"Fire\" is slang for something really great. The output replaces it with \"incredibly good.\" So maybe the instruction is to replace idiomatic expressions or colloquialisms with their more formal equivalents. But wait, \"fire\" isn't exactly an idiom; it's a term used in certain contexts. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a larger pattern where the friend is expanding or rephrasing phrases into more formal or elaborate language.\n\nSecond pair: Input \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" The original is a question asking capability. The output changes \"can\" to \"would be able to,\" which is more formal and uses a modal verb. It also adds \"accomplish,\" which might be a synonym but makes the sentence more active. Maybe the instruction is to rewrite questions in a more polite or formal tone, replacing \"can\" with \"would be able to\" and adding verbs like \"accomplish\" or \"execute.\"\n\nThird pair: Input \"I got what you said.\" → Output \"I understood you.\" The original is a short affirmative statement. The output turns it into a more direct question-like structure but uses \"understood\" instead of \"got.\" Maybe the rule here is to rephrase the sentence into a confirmation that the listener understood, possibly making it more conversational or using different phrasing.\n\nFourth pair: Input \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output \"She resembles her sister.\" Both use \"looks\" and \"resembles.\" Wait, actually, \"resembles\" is more formal. So maybe the friend is replacing informal terms with more formal ones. But \"look like\" and \"resemble\" can both mean similar things. However, the output uses \"resembles\" which is more precise. So perhaps the instruction is to replace common phrases with their more exact synonyms or formal versions.\n\nFifth pair: Input \"See you tonight.\" → Output \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" Here, the original is a casual greeting. The output is a more formal response expressing anticipation. So this could be a case of converting informal salutations into more polite expressions of looking forward.\n\nNow, compiling all these observations. The instruction likely asks the friend to rephrase each input in a more formal or elaborate way. Let's check if there's a common thread here. For the first example, replacing slang (\"fire\") with a formal adjective (\"incredibly good\"). Second, rephrasing a question with more polite phrasing. Third, rephrasing a short affirmation into a more direct expression of understanding. Fourth, replacing \"looks like\" with \"resembles\" for formality. Fifth, converting a casual greeting into a more formal anticipation statement.\n\nWait, but the fifth example's output is more than just changing the greeting; it transforms \"see you\" into a more formal expression of looking forward. That's a bit different from the others. So perhaps the instruction is to make the output more polite, formal, or expanded upon. However, let's see if there's another angle.\n\nAnother possibility is that the friend was instructed to provide a more creative or poetic rephrasing, but the examples don't seem poetic. The first example is straightforward substitution, the second a slight change in verb form and addition of a synonym, third a rephrasing into a question-like structure (but not exactly a question), fourth replacing \"look like\" with \"resemble,\" fifth converting an informal greeting into a more elaborate statement.\n\nLooking at the outputs, they often either expand the original meaning, use synonyms for more formal terms, rephrase questions into more polite forms, or turn simple statements into more expressive ones. The key common factor here is that each output is a more elaborate version of the input, sometimes in a different register (more formal) or phrasing.\n\nLet me consider possible instructions. One possibility is \"Expand each input into a more detailed or formal version.\" Another could be \"Redesign each sentence to be more polite or formal.\" Alternatively, maybe \"Use synonyms or rephrase each input to sound more sophisticated or elaborate.\" Let's test this against the examples.\n\nFor the first input: \"This song is fire.\" The output replaces \"fire\" with \"incredibly good,\" which is a synonym but more formal. The instruction could be to replace slang with more formal terms. However, \"incredibly good\" is more of an elaboration than a direct synonym. Similarly, in the third example, \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you,\" which is a slight rephrasing but not a synonym. Wait, \"got\" and \"understood\" are different. But in the context of confirmation, maybe it's about rephrasing the entire sentence rather than just substituting words.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to rewrite each input in a way that expresses the same idea but uses different wording, often in a more positive or formal tone. For instance, changing \"Can you...\" to a more polite form, \"I got...\" to \"I understood,\" \"she looks like...\" to \"she resembles,\" and so on.\n\nAnother angle: The outputs are often longer than the inputs. For example, \"Can you do...\" becomes a longer sentence. Similarly, \"See you...\" becomes a more elaborate statement. This suggests that the instruction might involve expanding the original sentence, adding more details or using more elaborate language.\n\nBut let's check each example again:\n\n1. \"This song is fire.\" → \"This song is incredibly good.\" The output is longer, uses a synonym but more descriptive.\n2. \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\" Longer, more formal.\n3. \"I got...\" → \"I understood you.\" Shorter? Wait, no, the output is shorter. Original: 6 words, output: 4 words. But maybe the user made a mistake in counting. Let me count again. \"I got what you said\" is 6 words. \"I understood you\" is 5 words. So slightly shorter. Hmm, not sure. Maybe the output is more concise but still rephrased.\n\nWait, the third input is \"I got what you said.\" The output is \"I understood you.\" So the original was a simple present tense statement, and the output is a more direct response, almost as if the speaker is confirming having understood the listener. Interesting.\n\nThe fourth input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" Both use \"resemble,\" but \"resembles\" is third person singular. Wait, no, the original uses \"looks like\" which is third person singular. The output uses \"resembles,\" same. So it's replacing \"look like\" with \"resemble,\" which is a more formal synonym.\n\nThe fifth input: \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" A complete transformation from a casual greeting to a more formal expression of anticipation. The output is much longer and more elaborate.\n\nSo putting all together, possible instructions could be:\n\n- Rewrite each input into a more polite or formal version, possibly expanding on the original meaning.\n- Replace informal expressions with more formal synonyms.\n- Convert questions into more polite requests.\n- Rephrase simple statements into more elaborate expressions of agreement or understanding.\n- Turn short greetings into more formal statements of looking forward.\n\nBut the key might be to notice that all outputs are transformed in a way that increases formality or elaboration. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction was to generate a response that matches a certain style, such as mimicking a specific tone or register.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for patterns in the transformations. For example:\n\n- \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\" (slight expansion and more descriptive)\n- \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\" (more polite, different verb construction)\n- \"I got...\" → \"I understood you\" (different structure, more direct)\n- \"She looks like...\" → \"She resembles...\" (synonym substitution, more formal)\n- \"See you...\" → \"I look forward to meeting you...\" (entirely different structure, more elaborate)\n\nLooking at the fifth example, the output is a full sentence expressing anticipation, whereas the input is an invitation. So perhaps the instruction is to respond to certain types of inputs with more elaborate statements, like converting casual plans into expressions of looking forward.\n\nWait, \"See you tonight\" is a casual greeting/invitation. The output is a more formal response expressing eagerness to meet, which is a common way to respond to such invitations.\n\nSimilarly, \"Can you do...\" is a question asking ability, and the output is phrased in a way that acknowledges the request with a more polite response.\n\nSo maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or elaborate version, particularly when responding to questions or requests.\n\nBut how to formulate this into a single instruction. Perhaps the original instruction was something like:\n\n\"Generate a more polite or formal version of each input, expanding upon the original message as needed.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to transform each input into a corresponding response in a specific style, such as turning questions into more polite affirmations and short statements into more elaborate expressions.\n\nAnother possibility: The instruction might have been to replace certain phrases with their more formal counterparts. For example, replacing \"look like\" with \"resemble,\" \"can\" with \"be able to,\" etc., while adjusting other parts of speech.\n\nBut looking at the first example, \"fire\" isn't a phrase that needs a replacement, but \"incredibly good\" is a more elaborate description. So maybe the instruction was to enhance the description by using more adjectives or synonyms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the friend was supposed to interpret each input as a question or statement and then answer it in a certain way. For instance:\n\n- If the input is a statement, rephrase it into a confirmation or elaboration.\n- If the input is a question, rephrase it into a more polite request.\n- If the input is an expression of likeness, rephrase it into a more formal comparison.\n\nIn that case, the instruction could be structured around different input types and their corresponding transformations.\n\nBut given the examples, it's challenging to pinpoint a single instruction. However, considering that all outputs are more elaborated, formal, or rephrased versions of the inputs, the most encompassing instruction would be:\n\n\"Rephrase each input into a more detailed, formal, or polite version, maintaining the core meaning but enhancing it through word choice, sentence structure, or elaboration.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been more specific, like \"Replace informal phrases with their formal equivalents and rephrase questions into more polite forms.\"\n\nBut to check, let's see if this instruction fits all examples:\n\n1. \"This song is fire.\" → Replace slang \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\" (more formal, detailed description).\n2. \"Can you...\" → Answer in a polite manner using \"be able to\" (formal structure) and \"accomplish\" (elaborate).\n3. \"I got...\" → Rephrase into a more direct confirmation (\"understood you\") (maintaining core message but different phrasing).\n4. \"She looks like...\" → Use \"resembles\" (formal synonym) and adjust to third person singular (consistent grammar).\n5. \"See you...\" → Convert into an expression of anticipation using \"look forward to\" (polite and formal).\n\nThis seems to fit. The instruction likely asks to rephrase each input into a more detailed, formal, or polite version. So the instruction was probably something like:\n\n\"Your task is to rewrite each input into a more polite, formal, or elaborated version, maintaining the original meaning but enhancing the expression through appropriate synonyms, sentence structure, or additional details.\"\n\nAlternatively, a more concise instruction might have been:\n\n\"Generate a more formal or elaborate version of each input.\"\n\nBut without seeing the exact instruction, it's challenging. However, based on the examples, the most plausible instruction is one that requires transforming each input into a more polite, formal, or expanded version. Therefore, the friend was asked to rephrase each input into a more detailed, refined, or appropriate response, often using synonyms, varying sentence structures, or adding elaboration.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to the friend was to **rewrite each input into a more polite, formal, or elaborated version**, enhancing the original message through synonyms, rephrasing, or additional details. \n\n### Key Transformations Identified:\n1. **Colloquialisms to Formal Terms**:  \n   - \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\" (replacing slang with descriptive adjectives).  \n2. **Question Politeness**:  \n   - \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\" (rephrasing with modals for formality).  \n3. **Confirmation Revisions**:  \n   - \"I got...\" → \"I understood you\" (adjusting phrasing for clarity).  \n4. **Synonym Substitution**:  \n   - \"looks like\" → \"resembles\" (using a more precise synonym).  \n5. **Greeting Etiquette**:  \n   - \"See you...\" → \"I look forward to...\" (transforming casual plans into polite anticipation).  \n\n### Final Instruction:  \n\"**Rewrite each input into a more detailed, formal, or polite version**, ensuring the core message remains intact while refining language, adjusting sentence structure, or adding elaboration.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs where a friend transformed each input into the given output. My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction based on these examples.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the input-output pairs again to see if I can spot any patterns or common transformations.\n\n1. Input: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\"\n   - Changed \"got\" to \"understood.\" Maybe \"got\" here is used in a colloquial sense, so replacing it with a more formal synonym.\n\n2. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n   - Replaced \"stand\" with \"tolerate.\" \"Can't stand\" is an idiom meaning \"can't tolerate,\" so changing the verb directly.\n\n3. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n   - Changed \"looks like\" to \"resembles.\" Both mean similar, but \"resembles\" might be a synonym or stylistic choice.\n\n4. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n   - Rewrote the entire sentence. Instead of a direct negation (\"can't tell\"), rephrased as \"find it hard to distinguish.\"\n\n5. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n   - Added a relative pronoun \"whom\" after \"lawyer.\" The original uses \"I met,\" which is fine, but maybe the instruction required inserting \"whom\" there for grammatical correctness?\n\nHmm. Let's analyze each transformation step by step.\n\nLooking at the first example: \"got\" is changed to \"understood.\" So perhaps the instruction is to replace certain words (like informal terms) with their more formal equivalents. But then why only \"got\"? Maybe the context matters. In the input sentence, \"got what you said\" is part of a conversation. Maybe the instruction is to rewrite casual expressions into more polite or standard phrasing.\n\nSecond input: \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate.\" Again, replacing the phrase with another phrase that conveys the same meaning but using different verbs. So maybe the task is to replace idiomatic expressions with their literal meanings or more formal alternatives.\n\nThird input: \"looks like\" → \"resembles.\" Same idea; both convey similarity, but one is a direct synonym. So replacing collocations with their synonyms.\n\nFourth input: Entirely rewritten. The output isn't just replacing a word but restructuring the sentence. The input is negative (\"can't tell the difference\"), but the output rephrases it as a difficulty (\"find it hard\"). So maybe the instruction is to rephrase negative statements into more passive or formal language.\n\nFifth input: Changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met.\" The original is correct grammatically, but maybe the instruction required inserting \"whom\" there. Alternatively, if the original used \"I met\" without \"whom,\" maybe the instruction required adding it to make the relative clause more formal. For example, \"the lawyer who I met\" vs. \"the lawyer whom I met.\" So maybe the instruction was to replace \"met\" with \"whom met\" in such contexts.\n\nWait, but in the input, it's \"The lawyer I met yesterday...\" So the original uses \"I met,\" which is okay. Adding \"whom\" would change it to \"The lawyer whom I met.\" So perhaps the instruction was to replace the relative pronoun \"who\" with \"whom\" when referring to oneself, especially in formal contexts. But why would that be necessary here? Because \"I met\" is correct, but maybe the instruction was about making the sentence more formal, which often includes using \"whom\" instead of \"who\" in certain clauses.\n\nPutting this all together, possible instruction could be:\n\n\"Replace informal or casual expressions with more formal equivalents. Use synonyms for common phrases, restructure sentences to improve clarity, and apply formal grammar rules where appropriate, such as replacing 'who' with 'whom' when needed.\"\n\nBut let me check again. For example, in the first input, \"got\" might not be considered informal. Maybe the context in which it's used makes it informal. If the input is a colloquial statement, changing it to a more standard phrasing. Similarly, \"can't stand\" is idiomatic, so changing to \"tolerate\" fits. The third example is a collocation replaced with a synonym. The fourth is a complete rephrasing for style. The fifth is a matter of grammar preference (using \"whom\" for formal tone).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to make the output more polite or formal, regardless of the exact wording. For instance, replacing contractions (\"can't\" with \"cannot\"), changing \"look like\" to \"resemble,\" etc. But why the fifth example? Maybe the instruction requires inserting \"whom\" whenever a relative pronoun is used after a noun phrase that refers back to the subject of the main clause. Wait, in the input sentence, the subject is \"The lawyer,\" and the relative clause is \"whom I met yesterday.\" Since the lawyer is the one being referred to, \"whom\" is correct here. But the original uses \"I met,\" which is also correct. So maybe the instruction was to replace \"met\" with \"whom met\" in such cases. That seems a bit specific, but possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to use a more formal relative pronoun when the antecedent is a person. For example, replacing \"who\" with \"whom\" in clauses like \"I met the lawyer who...\" to \"I met the lawyer whom...\" That could be part of a formal writing style guide.\n\nSo putting all these together, the instruction might be:\n\n\"Make each sentence more formal by replacing informal expressions with synonyms or rephrasing for clarity. Use more precise vocabulary where possible, restructure sentences to enhance coherence, and adhere to formal grammar rules such as using 'whom' in relative clauses when referring to people.\"\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, several involve synonym replacements and rephrasing. For example, \"could\" might not be present, but \"was able to\" could be another transformation. However, none of the inputs have \"could\" in them. So maybe it's not that.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to translate the input into more elegant or sophisticated English, adjusting verb tenses, prepositions, etc. But again, how does that fit with all examples?\n\nLet me check each input-output pair again for possible patterns:\n\n1. \"got\" → \"understood\": Could be a synonym substitution. But \"got\" here is part of a sentence structure like \"Got what you said?\" which is informal. The output uses \"understood,\" which is more formal. So perhaps the instruction was to replace colloquial expressions with more formal ones.\n\n2. \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\": Direct replacement of the entire phrase with another phrase having the same meaning but using more formal vocabulary.\n\n3. \"looks like\" → \"resembles\": Synonym substitution for a common phrase.\n\n4. \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\": Entire sentence restructuring. The output uses a more passive voice construction (\"find it hard to...\") compared to the active \"can't tell.\" This might be a way to rephrase in a more diplomatic or neutral tone.\n\n5. \"I met\" → \"whom I met\": Inserting \"whom\" after the noun to conform to formal grammar rules, possibly.\n\nSo the instruction might be a combination of tasks: replacing informal or slang terms with formal ones, rephrasing idiomatic expressions, using synonyms for common phrases, reworking sentences into more formal or neutral tones, and adhering to formal grammar (like using \"whom\" where appropriate).\n\nAnother possibility: The instruction could be to convert the first-person perspective into a more objective tone. For example, changing \"I\" to \"one\" or \"a person,\" but in these examples, \"I\" remains. So that's probably not it.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to adjust the level of formality. For instance, making the output more polite or formal than the input. Let's see:\n\nInput 1: Casual (\"got\") → Formal (\"understood\").\nInput 2: Idiomatic (\"can't stand\") → Formal synonym (\"tolerate\").\nInput 3: Common phrase (\"looks like\") → Synonym (\"resembles\").\nInput 4: Negative statement → Passive, less direct (\"find it hard\").\nInput 5: Grammatical structure adjusted (add \"whom\").\n\nYes, that matches. So the instruction is likely to make each sentence more formal in tone, using more precise vocabulary, rephrasing for clarity, and adhering to formal grammar conventions like inserting \"whom\" when appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the instruction could be something like:\n\n\"Refine each sentence by replacing informal or colloquial expressions with their more formal equivalents, rephrasing idioms into their literal meanings or more sophisticated synonyms, adjusting sentence structure for clarity and formality, and ensuring adherence to standard grammar rules such as using 'whom' in relative clauses when appropriate.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **convert informal or colloquial language into a more formal, polished style** by:\n\n1. **Replacing informal/vulgar words/phrases** (e.g., \"got\" → \"understood\", \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\") with their formal counterparts.\n2. **Rephrasing idiomatic expressions** (e.g., \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\").\n3. **Synonym substitution** for common phrases (e.g., \"looks like\" → \"resembles\").\n4. **Adjusting grammar for formality** (e.g., inserting \"whom\" after nouns like \"lawyer\" to follow formal relative clause constructions).\n5. **Restructuring sentences** for clarity and diplomacy (e.g., shifting from \"active\" to \"passive\" voice).\n\n**Final Instruction:**  \n\"Transform each input into a more formal, elegant version of the original text by replacing informal language, rephrasing idioms, using precise synonyms, adhering to formal grammar (e.g., using 'whom' in relative clauses), and restructuring sentences for clarity.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The goal is to reverse-engineer the process someone might use to transform each input into the given output. \n\nFirst, I need to look at each pair and see what changes or patterns exist. Let's list them again:\n\n1. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n   - So, the output starts with \"It is my opinion that...\" instead of \"I think that...\". The original subject (\"I\") is replaced with \"It\" and added \"is my opinion\". The main clause remains mostly the same except for \"think\" becoming \"be interesting\".\n\n2. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n   - Original question structure. The output is rephrased as a suggestion using \"Shall I...\" and \"accompany\" instead of \"go with\". The subject shifts from \"you\" (asking) to \"I\" (offering).\n\n3. Input: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\"\n   - Shortened from \"got what you said\" to \"understood you\". The verb \"got\" becomes \"understood\", and the pronoun \"you\" is moved from object to subject position.\n\n4. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n   - The original is a negation (\"can't tell\") which is changed to \"find it hard to\". The main verb \"tell\" becomes \"distinguish\", and \"difference\" is adjusted to \"distinguish between them\". The sentence structure shifts from a negative present tense to a more formal expression.\n\n5. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n   - Directly replaces \"looks like\" with \"resembles\", keeping the rest the same.\n\nNow, trying to find a common thread. Let's consider possible patterns:\n\n- Some sentences are transformed into more formal or polite versions.\n- Others seem to be rephrasing using synonyms or different structures.\n- The third example shows shortening while maintaining meaning.\n\nLet me check if all the outputs follow a similar rule. For instance:\n\nLooking at the first input-output pair:\nOriginal: First person (\"I think\") → Output: Third person (\"It is my opinion\"), replacing \"think\" with \"be interesting\". So maybe the instruction was to convert first-person statements into third-person with \"it is my opinion\" and adjust the verb to something like \"find interesting\"?\n\nSecond example: Second person question (\"Do you want...\") → Output is a third person offer (\"Shall I...\"). The structure shifts from asking to offering. So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase requests into suggestions using \"shall I\" and changing the verb.\n\nThird example: Shortened sentence (\"I got what you said\") → Output uses a different verb (\"understood\") and changes word order. Maybe the instruction was to replace certain verbs with their synonyms and adjust sentence structure.\n\nFourth example: Negative present tense (\"I can't...\") → Output uses a different structure (\"I find it hard to...\"). This might involve transforming negative statements into more formal expressions.\n\nFifth example: Direct replacement of \"look like\" with \"resemble\", but other parts remain the same. So perhaps for phrases like \"look like X\", replace with \"resemble X\".\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to take the input and apply specific transformations depending on the type of sentence or phrase. But how to unify this? Maybe the instruction is about converting certain types of statements into more formal or specific phrasings. For example:\n\n- If the input is a first-person opinion, rephrase as third-person with \"It is my opinion that...\" followed by the opinion in present tense.\n- If the input is a second-person question (like \"Do you want...\"), rephrase into a third-person suggestion using \"Shall I...\" and the verb \"accompany\" instead of \"go with\".\n- If the input is a statement expressing understanding, change \"got\" to \"understood\" and restructure the sentence.\n- If the input is a difficulty in telling apart, rephrase the inability into a neutral \"find hard to distinguish\".\n- For \"look like\", replace with \"resemble\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is more general. Let's think about the verbs being changed:\n\nIn the first input, \"think\" becomes \"be interesting\" (but actually, the output is \"It is my opinion that...\", so the main verb is \"is\". Wait, the original is \"I think that...\", output is \"It is my opinion that...\". The structure changes here. So perhaps the instruction involves restructuring the entire sentence.\n\nWait, maybe the friend was instructed to convert each input into a third-person statement, starting with \"It is my opinion that...\" when the input is a first-person statement, and similarly for other structures. But let's check:\n\nFor the first input: Original is first-person (\"I think...\"), output is third-person (\"It is my opinion that...\"). Similarly, the second input is second-person (\"Do you...\") which becomes third-person (\"Shall I...\"). The third input is first-person (\"I got what...\") which becomes third-person (\"I understood you\"). The fourth input is first-person (\"I can't tell...\") becomes third-person (\"I find it hard to...\"). The fifth input is third-person (\"She looks like...\") which becomes third-person but with a synonym (\"resembles\").\n\nWait, the fifth input is already third-person. So perhaps the instruction is to convert any first-person statements into third-person (using \"It is my opinion that...\"), second-person questions into third-person offers (\"Shall I...\"), and other transformations for specific cases like \"I got what...\".\n\nBut then the fifth input is third-person, so no change. Let's see:\n\nLooking at all outputs:\n\n1. From first-person opinion → third-person with \"It is my opinion that...\".\n\n2. Second-person question → third-person offer.\n\n3. First-person understanding → third-person (\"I understood you\").\n\n4. First-person inability → third-person (\"I find...\").\n\n5. Third-person similarity → third-person with \"resembles\".\n\nSo perhaps the overall instruction is: Convert the input into third-person singular form, using appropriate verbs and structures based on the original.\n\nLet me check each case against this hypothesis.\n\nFirst input: \"I think...\" → third-person would be \"He/She thinks...\". But the output is \"It is my opinion...\". So that doesn't match. So maybe that approach is not correct.\n\nAlternative idea: The instruction could be to convert first-person statements into third-person with a specific structure, but not just any third-person. For example, \"It is my opinion that...\" is a specific phrasing. But why third-person? Or maybe the instruction was to make the sentence more formal by rephrasing using \"it is my opinion\" when the original is first-person.\n\nWait, the output for the first input uses \"It is my opinion that...\", which is a way to express an opinion formally. So maybe the instruction was to turn any first-person statement into a third-person formal opinion expressed with \"It is my opinion that...\".\n\nLooking at the second input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" Here, the original is a second-person question. The output is a third-person offer using \"Shall I...\". So maybe the instruction is to take any request or suggestion in second person and rephrase it as a third-person offer.\n\nThird input: \"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\" The original is first-person understanding. The output shifts to \"I understood you.\" So maybe the instruction is to convert first-person understanding into \"I understood you\" or a similar phrasing.\n\nFourth input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" So here, the original is a negation of ability (\"can't tell\") which is rephrased into \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n\nFifth input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" So replacing \"look like\" with \"resemble\".\n\nPutting all this together, there seems to be multiple transformation rules. Each input triggers a different rule. However, the problem is to find the single instruction that encompasses all these cases. \n\nAnother angle: perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input using a synonym or a specific transformation. For example:\n\n- For opinions starting with \"I think...\", replace with \"It is my opinion that...\" followed by the rest.\n- For second-person questions about wanting something, rephrase as a third-person offer.\n- For \"I got what...\", replace with \"I understood\" and swap pronouns.\n- For \"I can't tell...\", replace with \"I find it hard to...\" plus adjusting the verb to 'distinguish'.\n- For \"look like\", replace with \"resemble\".\n\nBut this suggests multiple rules. However, the user mentioned the instruction was a single command. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input using a combination of these transformations, applicable as needed based on the input type.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the friend followed the instruction to give an output for every input. So the instruction must have been a set of rules that could be applied to any input to produce the corresponding output. However, the user provided five examples. Maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a more formal version using specific phrasing.\n\nAlternatively, looking at all outputs, they are all in third-person singular. Let's check:\n\n1. Output: third-person (It is...).\n\n2. Output: third-person (Shall I...).\n\n3. Output: first-person? Wait, no. Original was \"I understood you\", but output is \"I understood you\". Wait, original was \"I got what you said.\" → output is \"I understood you.\" So the subject is still \"I\", but the rest is adjusted. So the output here is first-person but with a changed verb and restructured.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. Because in the third example, the output is still first-person but the verb is changed. So maybe the instruction isn't a blanket conversion to third-person.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for common transformations between each input and output.\n\nFirst input:\nInput: \"I think...\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that...\".\nSo, replacing \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion that\", and keeping the rest of the sentence as is, adjusting only the first part.\n\nSecond input:\nInput: \"Do you...\" → Output: \"Shall I...\". So changing the verb from \"Do\" to \"Shall\", subject from \"you\" to \"I\", and changing \"want me to\" to \"accompany you\".\n\nThird input:\nInput: \"I got what...\" → Output: \"I understood you.\" Changing \"got\" to \"understood\" and restructuring the sentence to swap the pronoun's position.\n\nFourth input:\nInput: \"I can't tell the difference...\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish...\". Changing \"can't tell\" to \"find it hard to\" and changing the verb to \"distinguish\".\n\nFifth input:\nInput: \"She looks like...\" → Output: \"She resembles...\". Replacing \"look like\" with \"resemble\".\n\nLooking for a pattern here: Each output seems to either:\n\n- Replace a specific phrase (like \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion that...\")\n- Change a verb phrase (e.g., \"do you want...\" → \"shall I accompany...\")\n- Adjust word order (e.g., \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\")\n- Replace a verb phrase (e.g., \"look like\" → \"resemble\")\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to perform a specific transformation depending on the presence of certain keywords or structures. For example:\n\n- If the input contains \"I think that\", replace it with \"It is my opinion that\".\n- If the input is a second-person question about wanting, rephrase as \"Shall I...\" with the verb \"accompany\".\n- If the input expresses understanding, change \"got\" to \"understood\" and restructure.\n- If the input is about inability to tell apart, rephrase as \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n- If the input has \"look like\", replace with \"resemble\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more unified instruction. For instance, the instruction could be to convert each input into a more formal or third-person phrasing, using specific transformations where applicable. For example:\n\n- Any first-person expression of opinion (e.g., \"I think\") should be converted to \"It is my opinion that\".\n- Questions addressed to the speaker (\"Do you...\") should be rephrased as offers (\"Shall I...\").\n- Statements indicating understanding (\"I got\") should be changed to \"I understood you\".\n- Expressions of difficulty (\"can't tell\") should be rephrased as \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n- Phrases like \"look like\" should be replaced with \"resemble\".\n\nHowever, the key is that each input triggers a different rule. But the problem is to find the single instruction that could lead to these outputs. \n\nWait, another angle: Maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a third-person singular sentence, maintaining the core meaning but changing the perspective. However, this doesn't fit the first example because \"It is my opinion that\" introduces a new perspective. Alternatively, the instruction could be to use more formal language, which explains the third-person and phrasing like \"It is my opinion\". \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to make the sentence more passive or less direct. For example, changing \"I think\" to \"It is considered\" but that doesn't match the output. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, they often start with \"It is\" or \"Shall I\", which are different structures. So perhaps the instruction involved starting the sentence with a specific phrase depending on the input type.\n\nWait, let's look at the second example: \"Do you want...\" → \"Shall I...\". The structure here is changing the question from first-person (do you) to third-person (shall I), and changing \"want me to go with you\" to \"accompany you\". So maybe the instruction is to rephrase questions directed at the speaker into offers to do something on their behalf.\n\nSimilarly, the first example converts \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\". So maybe the instruction was to convert first-person opinions into third-person formal statements.\n\nThe third example changes \"I got what you said\" to \"I understood you\". So perhaps when someone says \"I got\", it's rephrased as \"I understood\".\n\nThe fourth example changes \"I can't tell\" to \"I find it hard to\". That's a common collocation, so maybe the instruction was to replace \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n\nThe fifth example replaces \"look like\" with \"resemble\". So that's a direct replacement.\n\nPutting all this together, it's likely that the instruction had multiple parts or rules for different types of inputs. However, since the user is asking for the single instruction that the friend followed, perhaps the instruction was a series of rules or steps that need to be applied in order, or perhaps there's a more overarching pattern.\n\nWait, another thought: All outputs seem to start with \"It is\", \"Shall I\", or \"I understood\". So maybe the instruction was to rewrite each input using one of these phrases based on certain conditions. For example:\n\n- If the input starts with \"I think\", use \"It is my opinion that...\" followed by the rest of the sentence.\n- If the input is a second-person question (Do you...), rephrase as \"Shall I...\" plus the action part.\n- If the input expresses understanding via \"got\", change to \"understood\" and rephrase.\n- If the input is an inability to tell apart, rephrase to \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n- If the input uses \"look like\", replace with \"resemble\".\n\nBut this still lists multiple rules. However, the problem states that the instruction was a single instruction, possibly in natural language. Perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or standard English version, using specific templates based on the input structure.\n\nLooking for a unifying principle across all examples:\n\n- The outputs avoid contractions (e.g., \"I can't\" becomes \"I find it hard to\"), use more formal language.\n- Some use third-person (e.g., \"It is my opinion\", \"Shall I\", \"She resembles\").\n- The friend might have been instructed to convert certain types of expressions into their more standard forms.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to convert each input into a third-person passive voice, but none of the outputs seem passive. For example, \"It is my opinion\" is active, not passive.\n\nAlternatively, considering that some outputs replace \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion\", which is a way to attribute the thought to the speaker, but in a more formal way. So maybe the instruction was to make the statement more objective-sounding by removing the first-person perspective.\n\nAnother angle: The outputs all start with a different subject or structure. For example:\n\n- The first output starts with \"It\", changing the subject to the sentence itself.\n- The second starts with \"Shall I\", suggesting an action.\n- The third is \"I understood you\", similar to the original.\n- The fourth is a rephrased inability.\n- The fifth is a synonym replacement.\n\nThis suggests that the instruction wasn't a single rule but a collection of specific substitutions or transformations applied conditionally.\n\nGiven that the user provided five examples and asked for the instruction, the most plausible answer is that the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or standardized version using specific phrasings where applicable. However, the exact instruction would need to cover the various cases mentioned.\n\nWait, looking back at the first example: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" This transformation could be seen as adding a formal prefix (\"It is my opinion that...\") when the input expresses an opinion. Similarly, the second example turns a question into an offer, the third into a rephrased understanding, the fourth into a neutral difficulty statement, and the fifth into a synonym. \n\nIf we group these transformations, perhaps the instruction was to:\n\n- For statements expressing personal opinion (e.g., \"I think\"), rephrase as \"It is my opinion that...\".\n\n- For questions addressed to the speaker (e.g., \"Do you want\"), rephrase as offers using \"Shall I...\".\n\n- For expressions of understanding (e.g., \"I got what\"), rephrase to \"I understood\".\n\n- For inability to discern differences (e.g., \"I can't tell the difference\"), rephrase as \"I find it hard to distinguish\".\n\n- For comparisons using \"look like\", replace with \"resemble\".\n\nBut since the user wants a single instruction, perhaps the instruction was to rewrite each input according to the following rules:\n\n1. If the input begins with \"I think that\", replace with \"It is my opinion that\".\n\n2. If the input is a second-person question starting with \"Do you\", rephrase as \"Shall I\" followed by the rest of the question's content, replacing \"want me to\" with \"accompany\".\n\n3. If the input ends with \"what you said\", change to \"understood you\".\n\n4. If the input includes \"can't tell the difference between\", rephrase as \"find it hard to distinguish between",

The user provided five input-output pairs, and I need to determine what the initial instruction was that led the friend to generate those outputs. \n\nFirst, I'll look at each pair and see if there's a pattern or transformation rule that connects the input to the output. Let's start with the first example:\n\nInput: \"The whole story was made up.\" Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n\nHmm, comparing these two sentences. The output seems more formal. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more polite or professional tone? Or perhaps it's about converting colloquial expressions into more standard language. The first sentence uses \"was made up,\" which could mean either invented or not true. The output uses \"fabricated,\" which means specifically made up, not necessarily false. But in context, both could fit. However, maybe the key here is replacing \"made up\" with \"fabricated\" as a synonym. Let's check other examples.\n\nSecond input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n\nThis looks like changing the phrasing from a casual question (\"want\") to a more formal or old-fashioned alternative (\"shall I accompany\"). So maybe the instruction is to convert questions into polite requests using formal language or antiquated terms.\n\nThird input: \"This song is fire.\" Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\n\nHere, \"fire\" is slang for excellent. The output replaces it with a more descriptive phrase. So maybe the instruction is to translate slang into more formal descriptors.\n\nFourth input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n\nThis changes the input, which is a negative opinion, into a more positive and formal suggestion. The original is a personal opinion, while the output frames it as a suggestion. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase statements into recommendations or suggestions, especially when the original is against an action.\n\nFifth input: \"Please call once you get there.\" Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n\nHere, \"once you get there\" is rephrased as \"upon your arrival,\" which is a slight change in wording but still conveying the same meaning. So perhaps the instruction is to replace certain phrases with synonyms or formal alternatives.\n\nNow, looking for a common thread. Each output seems to be a rephrasing with increased formality, perhaps using more polite or elevated language. The first example uses \"entire\" instead of \"whole,\" which is a more formal term. The second uses \"shall I accompany\" instead of \"do you want me to...\" The third turns slang into a descriptive adjective. The fourth turns a negative opinion into a positive suggestion. The fifth replaces a casual phrasing with a more formal one.\n\nWait, the fourth example is particularly interesting because the input is a statement of opinion, and the output is a suggestion. That might suggest that the instruction was to turn negative opinions into positive recommendations. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more polite or professional tone, using different structures. Let's consider the possible instruction options.\n\nPossible instructions could be:\n- Convert colloquial language to formal English.\n- Rewrite questions into formal polite requests.\n- Replace informal expressions with their formal equivalents.\n- Turn negative opinions into positive suggestions.\n- Rephrase using synonyms for specific words.\n\nBut the key is that all five examples follow this transformation. Let's check the first example again. \"Was made up\" becomes \"fabricated.\" Could that be part of the instruction? Maybe replace \"made up\" with \"fabricated\" as a synonym, but why would that be part of a general instruction? Unless the original instruction was to correct grammar or use specific terms.\n\nLooking at the second example, changing \"do you want\" to \"shall I accompany.\" The structure here is changing the subject (you) to a more formal \"accompany\" and using \"shall I\" which is an older construction. So perhaps the instruction was to convert questions into formal offers.\n\nThe third example is replacing slang with a more formal description. So maybe the instruction is to eliminate informal or slang terms.\n\nThe fourth example is changing a negative statement into a positive suggestion. That suggests the instruction is to rephrase negative opinions into positive recommendations.\n\nThe fifth example is replacing \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival.\" So changing a casual phrasing to a more formal one.\n\nPutting this together, it seems the instruction was to transform each input into a more formal, polite, or elevated version. The key elements would be replacing informal expressions with formal ones, converting questions into offers or polite requests, handling slang, and rephrasing negative opinions into suggestions.\n\nWait, but the fourth example is tricky. If the original is a statement like \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now,\" the output is \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" That's a clear shift from an opinion to a recommendation. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase any statement of negative opinion into a positive suggestion. But does that apply to all the examples? Let's check:\n\nFirst example: input is a factual statement (the story was made up), output uses \"fabricated\" (same level). Not sure if that fits.\n\nSecond example: input is a question, output is a formal offer.\n\nThird example: slang replaced with description.\n\nFourth example: opinion turned into a suggestion.\n\nFifth example: casual phrasing into formal.\n\nSo maybe the instruction was to make each input more formal and polite. The fourth example stands out because it changes a negative opinion into a suggestion. But perhaps the core instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal tone, which can include turning opinions into suggestions where appropriate. Alternatively, the instruction might have been to replace certain phrases with their formal counterparts, like changing \"made up\" to \"fabricated,\" \"want\" to \"accompany,\" etc.\n\nAnother angle: looking for common transformations. For example, the first input uses \"whole story\" and output is \"entire story.\" \"Whole\" vs \"entire\" are synonyms. Similarly, \"made up\" vs \"fabricated.\" So maybe the instruction was to replace \"whole\" with \"entire,\" \"made up\" with \"fabricated,\" etc. But why would the friend do that for all inputs unless there was a list of such replacements?\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to perform a series of edits based on specific word lists. For example, replace \"whole\" with \"entire,\" \"made up\" with \"fabricated,\" \"want\" with \"accompany,\" \"fire\" with \"incredibly good,\" etc. But the problem states that the friend read the instruction and followed it for all inputs. However, without knowing the exact instruction, we have to infer based on the examples.\n\nWait, but maybe the instruction is more general. Let's think about the outputs:\n\n1. Formal language conversion: inputs are rephrased in a more formal way. For example, replacing contractions (\"don't think\" to \"is suggested\"), changing \"want\" to \"accompany,\" etc.\n\n2. Slang replacement: \"fire\" → \"incredibly good.\"\n\n3. Question to offer: \"Do you...\" → \"Shall I...\"\n\n4. Negative opinion to positive suggestion.\n\n5. Casual phrasing to formal (\"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\").\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is a combination of these: to convert the input into a more formal, polite, or elevated style, possibly including replacing informal terms, changing question structures, turning negative opinions into suggestions, and rephrasing certain phrases.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to correct grammatical errors or improve style. But how?\n\nAnother approach: looking for a possible rule or pattern that applies to all inputs. For example, each output is a noun phrase substitution or verb phrase substitution.\n\nFirst input: \"whole story\" → \"entire story,\" \"made up\" → \"fabricated.\" So replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\" Similarly, second input: \"want\" → \"accompany\" and \"Do you...\" → \"Shall I...\" Third: \"fire\" → \"incredibly good.\" Fourth: \"don't think it's a good idea\" → \"suggested that no action should be taken.\" Fifth: \"call once you get there\" → \"call upon your arrival.\"\n\nThis seems inconsistent. Unless there's a systematic substitution based on specific words. But given that all inputs are different, it's hard to find a universal substitution.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to rephrase each sentence using a thesaurus, replacing certain keywords with synonyms. But why would that be a general instruction? Or perhaps the friend was following a set of specific rules, like replacing \"made up\" with \"fabricated,\" \"want\" with \"accompany,\" etc., which the user forgot to mention.\n\nBut the user says they gave the instruction and five inputs, so the friend followed that instruction. Therefore, the instruction must cover all five cases. Let's try to hypothesize what the instruction could have been.\n\nPerhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, using different structures. For example:\n\n- For any statement or question, rewrite it in a more polite or professional tone.\n- Replace informal expressions with more formal alternatives.\n- Convert questions into offers or polite requests.\n- Turn negative opinions into positive suggestions.\n- Replace colloquial phrases with their formal equivalents.\n\nThis seems plausible. The instruction was to make each input more formal, polite, and elevated, possibly by converting questions into offers, replacing negative opinions with suggestions, and using more formal language overall.\n\nTo confirm, let's check each input-output pair against this hypothesis:\n\n1. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Formal, using \"entire\" and \"fabricated\" instead of \"whole\" and \"made up.\" Fits the hypothesis.\n\n2. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\" This changes a casual question into a formal offer. Fits.\n\n3. Input: \"This song is fire.\" Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\" Replaces slang with a formal descriptor. Fits.\n\n4. Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" Converts a negative opinion into a suggestion. Fits.\n\n5. Input: \"Please call once you get there.\" Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\" Changes \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival,\" a more formal phrasing. Fits.\n\nAll examples align with this hypothesis. Therefore, the instruction was likely to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or elevated version, possibly involving structural changes like converting questions into offers, turning negative opinions into suggestions, and replacing informal language with formal equivalents.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or elevated version**, incorporating specific transformations such as:\n1. Converting questions into formal offers (e.g., \"Do you want...\" → \"Shall I...\").\n2. Eliminating informal expressions (e.g., \"made up\" → \"fabricated,\" \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\").\n3. Turning negative opinions into positive recommendations (e.g., \"don’t think it’s a good idea\" → \"suggested to avoid action\").\n4. Refining casual phrasing into more formal language (e.g., \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\").\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or elevated version by replacing informal terms, converting questions into offers, eliminating slang, and restructuring sentences for a more professional tone.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs, and we need to reverse-engineer what the instruction might have been. \n\nFirst, let's look at each pair and see if there's a pattern or transformation involved. Maybe the instruction was something like \"Rewrite the sentence to...\" but different for each case? Wait, but the outputs vary differently for each input. Let's go through them one by one.\n\n1. Input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\"\n   - Here, the original sentence uses \"got\" in a colloquial sense, and the output replaces it with \"understood.\" Also, the pronoun shifts from \"you\" (object) to \"you\" as subject. But wait, the original is \"I got what you said\" (using \"you\" as object of \"got\"), and the output is \"I understood you.\" So maybe the instruction was to replace \"got\" with \"understood,\" and also to change the second \"you\" to \"you\" as the subject. Wait, but the output's \"you\" is the same as the input's \"you\"? Hmm. Wait, in the input, \"got what you said\" has \"you\" as the direct object. In the output, \"understood you\" still has \"you\" as direct object. But the first \"you\" in the input is the direct object, and the second \"you\" in the input is part of the phrase \"what you said.\" So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase \"got\" to \"understood,\" and the \"you\" remains the same? Or maybe not. Let me check another example.\n\n2. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n   - Original uses \"can't tell the difference,\" output uses \"find it hard to distinguish.\" So replacing \"can't tell\" with \"find it hard to...\" Maybe the instruction was to rephrase the expression into a more formal version. Also, \"difference\" vs \"distinguish between.\" Another possibility: sometimes people say \"can't tell the difference\" but prefer to say \"have trouble distinguishing.\"\n\n3. Third input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n   - Here, the input uses a non-restrictive relative clause \"I met yesterday,\" and the output changes \"I met\" to \"whom I met.\" So inserting a relative pronoun \"whom\" to make it more formal. So maybe the instruction was to add \"whom\" when the clause starts with the verb \"met\"? But the original uses \"I met yesterday,\" which is after the noun. Wait, in the input, the relative clause is \"I met yesterday,\" and the output changes it to \"whom I met yesterday.\" So perhaps the instruction was to convert any possessive pronoun in the relative clause to \"whom\" when referring to the subject?\n\n4. Fourth input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n   - Original uses \"I think\" leading to a statement. The output replaces \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion.\" So the instruction might have been to rephrase \"I think\" into a more formal \"it is my opinion,\" and also remove the \"that\" perhaps? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to restate the sentence using \"It is my opinion\" and restructure the rest accordingly.\n\n5. Fifth input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n   - Original is a negative statement about not thinking it's a good idea. The output rephrases it into a suggestion using \"It is suggested that...\" structure, and instead of \"do anything,\" it becomes \"no action should be taken.\" The time phrase \"right now\" is changed to \"at this stage.\" So maybe the instruction was to rephrase negative thoughts into positive suggestions and use a specific structure.\n\nNow, looking for common patterns across all examples:\n\n- Each output seems to use more formal language.\n- Some transformations involve changing verbs (e.g., \"got\" → \"understood\"), but not all.\n- Others involve restructuring clauses (like adding \"whom\" in the third example).\n- The fourth and fifth examples involve changing \"I think\" into a more formal expression, and the fifth involves turning a negative statement into a suggestion phrased with \"It is suggested that...\" and rephrasing \"do anything\" into \"take no action.\"\n\nPerhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal tone, possibly making suggestions where necessary. However, the third example shows a different kind of transformation (adding \"whom\"). Let's check that again:\n\nThird input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\nWait, in the original, the relative clause is \"I met yesterday,\" and in the output, it's \"whom I met yesterday.\" So here, they replaced \"I met\" with \"whom I met.\" So perhaps the instruction was to insert \"whom\" whenever the relative clause comes after the noun? But in the original, the clause is \"I met yesterday,\" which is after the noun. The output changes that to \"whom I met yesterday,\" so inserting \"whom\" before the verb. So maybe the instruction was: For any relative clause starting with \"I/me,\" replace \"I/me + past participle\" with \"whom + past participle\" in the relative clause.\n\nAnother observation: In the first example, the output changes \"got\" to \"understood\" and the pronoun order. But \"you\" in the input is the same in both places. Wait, in the original input, \"I got what you said.\" The output is \"I understood you.\" So the original had \"you\" as the direct object of \"got,\" and the output's \"you\" is still the direct object. But in the third example, the output's \"whom\" is inserted into the relative clause. So perhaps the instructions are not uniform across all aspects, but there's a mix of different transformations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each sentence according to certain templates. For example, for each input, replace \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion that,\" and change \"don't think\" into \"It is suggested that no action...\", etc. But the third example doesn't fit that. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase into more formal language, using different constructions based on context.\n\nAnother angle: Perhaps the instruction was to convert each sentence into passive voice? Let's check:\n\nOriginal 1: \"I got what you said.\" Passive would be \"What you said was got by me.\" Not matching the output. Output is \"I understood you.\"\n\nOriginal 2: Passive would be \"The difference is told to me by you.\" No, not matching. So probably not passive.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a question. For example, original 1: \"Did I get what you said?\" But output is \"I understood you.\" Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase into an indirect statement. Like, original 1 becomes \"He said he understood me.\" But output is \"I understood you.\" Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. The first example's output seems to replace \"got\" with \"understood\" and the second \"you\" remains. Wait, but in the input, the two \"you\"s are the same word. So maybe the instruction was to change any instance of \"you\" to \"you\" (same?), but in the third example, the \"you\" is replaced with \"whom.\" Wait, no, in the third example, the output's \"you\" is the same as the input's. So perhaps that's not it.\n\nLooking at the third example again: \"I met yesterday\" becomes \"whom I met yesterday.\" So inserting \"whom\" before the verb. So perhaps whenever the relative clause starts with \"I met,\" replace \"I met\" with \"whom I met.\" But why only in that case? Not sure.\n\nFourth example: \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion that.\" So that's a standard form of expressing personal opinions more formally.\n\nFifth example: The structure \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything...\" is turned into \"It is suggested that no action should be taken...\" So the instruction here was to rephrase the original negative statement into a suggestion phrased with \"It is suggested that...\"\n\nSo putting it together, the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more formal tone, using different strategies depending on the original sentence structure. For instance:\n\n- If the sentence contains \"I think,\" rewrite it as \"It is my opinion that...\"\n- Replace \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish...\"\n- Add \"whom\" before the verb in relative clauses that start with \"I met\"\n- Convert \"got what you said\" to \"understood you\"\n- Change negative suggestions into positive suggestions using \"It is suggested that...\" and rephrase \"do anything\" into \"take no action\"\n\nBut this seems too piecemeal. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was more general, like \"Convert each sentence into a more formal version by using appropriate substitutions and structures.\"\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, perhaps the instruction was to replace certain phrases with others:\n\nFor example:\n- \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\"\n- \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion that...\"\n- \"don't think\" → \"It is suggested that...\"\n- \"got what you said\" → \"understood you\"\n- \"was helpful\" → \"was helpful\" (no change)\n- \"right now\" → \"at this stage\"\n\nBut the third input's \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met,\" which isn't a substitution but a restructuring. So maybe the instruction had multiple parts, requiring different transformations for different cases.\n\nAnother approach: Look for common elements in the outputs. For example:\n\n- All outputs seem to avoid first-person pronouns except when replacing. Wait, the first output is \"I understood you.\" So the original had \"I\" as subject, and the output also uses \"I\" as subject. So maybe the instruction was to keep the subject as is, but rephrase the rest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the entire sentence into a different structure, such as turning declarative sentences into questions, or making suggestions. But the examples don't fit that.\n\nWait, let's look at the outputs again:\n\n1. Original: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\"\n   - \"Got\" replaced with \"understood,\" no change to \"you.\"\n   \n2. Original: \"I can't tell the difference...\" Output: \"I find it hard...\"\n   - Changed \"can't tell\" to \"find it hard.\"\n   \n3. Original: \"The lawyer I met...\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met...\"\n   - Inserted \"whom\" before \"met.\"\n   \n4. Original: \"I think that this is interesting.\" Output: \"It is my opinion...\"\n   - Replaced \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion.\"\n   \n5. Original: \"We don't think it's a good idea...\" Output: \"It is suggested...\"\n   - Changed \"don't think\" to \"is suggested\" and rephrased the content.\n\nSo each output uses a different type of transformation. This suggests that the instruction might have been a set of rules applied conditionally based on certain keywords or structures. For example:\n\n- If the sentence starts with \"I think,\" replace it with \"It is my opinion that...\"\n- If the sentence has \"can't tell the difference,\" replace with \"find it hard to distinguish...\"\n- If the sentence contains \"met,\" and the relative clause starts with \"I met,\" add \"whom\" before the verb.\n- If the sentence has \"got,\" replace with \"understood.\"\n- If the sentence is negative (\"We don't think...\"), turn it into a positive suggestion using \"It is suggested that...\" and rephrase \"do anything\" to \"take no action\" along with changing \"right now\" to \"at this stage.\"\n\nBut how to generalize this into an instruction? Maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal tone, possibly using different strategies depending on the original phrasing. The key is that each output follows a certain rule that transforms the input into a more formal version.\n\nLooking back, the third example stands out because it involves restructuring the relative clause by inserting \"whom.\" This seems like a specific rule: when the relative clause begins with \"I met,\" insert \"whom\" before \"met.\" Similarly, the fourth example is about replacing \"I think\" with a more formal opinion statement. The fifth example is about turning a negative statement into a positive suggestion phrased with \"It is suggested that...\" and changing the content accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the original instruction could have been something like:\n\n\"Rephrase each input into a more formal tone by following these steps:\n1. Replace 'I think' with 'It is my opinion that...'\n2. Replace 'can't tell the difference' with 'find it hard to distinguish...'\n3. When the relative clause starts with 'I met,' insert 'whom' before the verb in the relative clause.\n4. Replace 'got what you said' with 'understood you.'\n5. Convert any statement beginning with 'We don't think it's a good idea...' into 'It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage,' while changing 'do anything' to 'take no action' and 'right now' to 'at this stage.'\"\n\nHowever, this seems a bit scattered. Alternatively, the instruction might have been more concise but covering these cases. But since the examples cover different types of transformations, the instruction likely required applying various possible transformations based on the input's structure.\n\nAnother possibility: The instruction was to translate each sentence into a suggestion or opinion form, using \"It is suggested that\" or \"It is my opinion that\" for some inputs, while others were transformed into passive or different constructions. But the third example doesn't fit into that.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, the first example's output is similar in structure to the fourth and fifth, but others are different. Maybe the instruction was to make the sentences more indirect or formal. For example:\n\n\"Make each sentence more formal by using appropriate substitutions and structures, such as replacing informal expressions with more formal alternatives, rephrasing opinions, or converting statements into questions where necessary.\"\n\nBut the examples don't include questions. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction was to use reported speech. Let's check:\n\nOriginal 1: \"I got what you said.\" If converted to reported speech, it would be \"He said that I got what he said.\" But output is \"I understood you.\" Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction was to rephrase each sentence into its opposite meaning. For example:\n\nOriginal 1: \"I got what you said\" → \"I didn't get what you said.\" But output is \"I understood you,\" which is the opposite. But in other examples, like original 2: input is \"can't tell the difference,\" output is \"find it hard,\" which is similar in meaning. Not opposites. So probably not.\n\nAnother angle: Looking for a common thread across all outputs. For example, the outputs often include \"It is...\" which appears in the fourth and fifth examples. The fourth says \"It is my opinion,\" the fifth says \"It is suggested.\" So maybe the instruction was to start certain outputs with \"It is...\" phrases. But the first example doesn't follow that.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to convert each input into a question. Let's see:\n\nOriginal 1: \"I got what you said.\" As a question, \"Did I get what you said?\" Output is \"I understood you.\" Doesn't match.\n\nOriginal 2: \"Can't tell the difference...\" → \"Do you have trouble telling the difference?\" Output is \"I find it hard to distinguish.\" Still doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each sentence into a different tense or voice. For example, present perfect instead of simple past. But original 1 is present perfect (\"I got\"), output is past tense (\"understood you\").\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to use more descriptive adjectives. But the outputs don't seem to do that. For example, original 3: \"helpful\" stays the same, but output adds \"whom.\" So not it.\n\nLet's look back at the third example. The output adds \"whom I met\" instead of \"I met.\" So perhaps whenever the relative clause starts with \"I met,\" replace \"I met\" with \"whom I met.\" That seems specific. Similarly, the fourth example's \"I think\" is replaced with \"It is my opinion.\" The fifth example turns \"don't think\" into \"is suggested.\"\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was: Apply the following transformations in order:\n\n1. If the sentence starts with \"I think,\" replace it with \"It is my opinion that...\"\n2. If the sentence contains \"can't tell the difference,\" replace with \"find it hard to distinguish...\"\n3. If the sentence has \"got,\" replace with \"understood.\"\n4. If the sentence ends with \"right now,\" change it to \"at this stage.\"\n5. If the relative clause starts with \"I met,\" insert \"whom\" before the verb.\n6. If the sentence starts with \"We don't think,\" replace with \"It is suggested that...\" and adjust the content to \"no action should be taken.\"\n\nBut this is speculative. Alternatively, the instruction might have been more open-ended, like \"Rewrite each sentence into a more formal version by adjusting vocabulary and structure appropriately,\" but the examples suggest that different parts of the sentence are being transformed based on their structure.\n\nGiven that the outputs vary widely, but each seems to apply a specific transformation based on the input's structure, the most plausible instruction is that for each input, the assistant was supposed to rephrase the sentence into a more formal version using one of the observed transformations. However, without seeing the exact instruction, it's challenging to pinpoint.\n\nBut considering common writing advice, the instruction might have been to make each sentence more formal by rephrasing opinions, converting negative statements into positive suggestions, adding relative pronouns where needed, and replacing colloquial expressions with more formal equivalents.\n\nAnother thought: The first example's output could be part of a common translation or rewriting task. For instance, in some contexts, replacing \"got\" with \"understood\" when someone explains something. Similarly, the third example adds \"whom\" to formalize the relative clause.\n\nPutting all this together, the instruction likely involved a combination of different transformations based on the input's structure, aiming to produce more formal, professional-sounding sentences. Each input may trigger a different set of rules:\n\n- Replace \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion that...\"\n- Replace \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish...\"\n- Add \"whom\" before \"met\" in relative clauses\n- Replace \"got\" with \"understood\"\n- Convert negative suggestions into positive ones phrased as \"It is suggested that...\" with adjusted content\n\nBut since the instruction must be a single, coherent set of guidelines, perhaps the user intended for the assistant to apply certain common transformations to make the sentences more formal",

The task involves looking at the given input-output pairs and deducing the general rule or transformation applied. \n\nFirst, I'll list out each pair to see if there's a pattern:\n\n1. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n   - Here, the phrase \"can't stand\" is rephrased as \"cannot tolerate.\" So, maybe the instruction is to replace \"can't\" with \"cannot,\" but let's check other examples.\n\n2. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n   - The original uses \"considered many,\" but the output changes to \"Various approaches were considered.\" This seems like changing the way to describe the action. Maybe replacing \"considered\" with a synonym or restructuring the sentence to use a different subject-verb structure. Alternatively, it could be about pluralizing \"approaches\" and adding \"were\" which wasn't there before. Wait, the original didn't have \"were considered,\" so maybe the output uses past continuous tense? Let me check grammar. Original is simple past (\"considered\"), output is past passive (\"were considered\"). That might be it. So perhaps the instruction was to convert the verb to its passive voice past tense form. But then let's see another example.\n\n3. Input: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n   - This seems like a completely different structure. The output turns a greeting into a statement expressing anticipation. So the instruction here might involve transforming certain phrases into more formal or positive versions. For example, turning informal greetings into expressions of looking forward to seeing someone.\n\n4. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n   - \"Made up\" vs. \"fabricated.\" These are synonyms. So replacing \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\" But \"whole\" becomes \"entire,\" which is another synonym. So perhaps replacing certain phrases with more formal terms or synonyms.\n\n5. Input: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n   - \"Once you get there\" is replaced with \"upon your arrival.\" So again, synonyms or rephrasing. \"Once\" can mean \"when,\" but \"upon\" is another preposition indicating a specific event. So maybe replacing temporal expressions with different phrasing.\n\nNow, trying to find a common thread. Let's categorize possible transformations:\n\n- Grammatical structure (passive voice, past tense),\n- Synonyms or paraphrases,\n- Sentence type (declarative to different types, e.g., passive vs. active),\n- Formality (informal to formal),\n- Different tenses,\n- Prepositions or connectors.\n\nLooking at all examples:\n\n1. \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" (synonym, grammatical change).\n2. Active → passive voice (changed to passive with \"were considered\").\n3. Greeting → formal expression of anticipation (change in structure and meaning).\n4. \"whole\" → \"entire,\" \"made up\" → \"fabricated\" (synonyms).\n5. \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\" (synonym/prepositional phrase).\n\nHmm. It's not a straightforward synonym replacement. Some involve grammatical changes (like passive voice), others structural changes (greeting to statement). Maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version using synonyms and appropriate grammatical structures. For instance, making the sentence more polite, formal, or converting it into a different sentence type.\n\nWait, in example 3, the original is a casual \"See you,\" and the output is a polite expression of looking forward. That suggests a more formal, positive rephrasing. Similarly, example 1 uses a synonym. Example 5 uses a synonym for \"once.\" Example 4 has \"entire\" and \"fabricated\" instead of \"whole\" and \"made up.\" So perhaps the instruction is to replace certain words/phrases with their formal equivalents, adjust grammar (like passive voice), and sometimes restructure the sentence.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the verb tenses. Example 2 changes \"considered\" to \"were considered\" (past passive), while the first input uses \"can't stand,\" which is present tense. The output for that uses \"cannot tolerate,\" which is also present tense. So tense changes might not be the key unless it's a specific condition, but the third example is present simple, output is present continuous (though not exactly). Not sure.\n\nWait, in example 3, the original is a future tense (\"tonight\"), but the output doesn't explicitly state time, just expresses anticipation. So maybe handling time references differently.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each output is an improvement or a more correct version. Let's think: for example, \"made up\" as a phrase can sometimes be considered incorrect if the intended meaning is fabrication rather than imagination. So maybe the instruction was to correct such usages. But the first example replaces \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate,\" which is a direct synonym. The second example is changing active to passive. Third is changing informal greeting to formal statement. Fourth is replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\" Fifth is replacing \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival.\"\n\nSo, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or correct version, using synonyms, adjusting grammar (like passive voice), and possibly restructuring sentences. For example, correcting collocations, making the language more polite, using more formal prepositions, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more polite version, but some examples don't fit that. For instance, the first input is already polite, and the output is similar. The second example is neutral. The third is a greeting turned into a statement. The fourth is a correction in phrasing. The fifth uses a different phrasing for a similar idea.\n\nWait, maybe the instruction was to rewrite the input in a more formal register. For example, replacing contractions (like \"can't\" to \"cannot\"), changing informal phrases to more formal ones (e.g., \"made up\" to \"fabricated\"), using more formal connectors (like \"upon\" instead of \"once\"), and restructuring sentences to sound more polite or professional.\n\nLet me check another angle: looking for recurring patterns. For example:\n\n- In example 1: \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate.\" Here, the contraction is expanded, but also the phrase itself is replaced with a synonym. But why not just expand the contraction? Maybe the instruction was to replace certain phrases with synonyms.\n\n- Example 2: active to passive voice, but only in the sense of using \"were considered.\" So perhaps the instruction was to convert the verb to passive voice past tense.\n\nBut then, example 3 is a greeting becoming a statement, which isn't passive voice. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to perform multiple transformations: for example, expanding contractions, replacing some phrases with synonyms, converting to passive voice where applicable, rephrasing greetings, etc.\n\nWait, let's consider possible instructions that could apply:\n\n1. Expand contractions (like \"can't\" to \"cannot\").\n2. Replace informal phrases with more formal synonyms (e.g., \"couldn't stand\" → \"could not endure\").\n3. Convert active voice to passive where possible.\n4. Restructure sentences to be more polite (e.g., informal greetings to formal expressions of anticipation).\n5. Adjust adjectives or nouns (e.g., \"whole\" to \"entire,\" \"made up\" to \"fabricated\").\n6. Use different connectors or prepositions (e.g., \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\").\n\nGiven that each input-output pair seems to require a combination of these steps, maybe the instruction was a combination of several rules. For example:\n\n\"Replace contractions with full forms, rephrase informal expressions with formal synonyms, convert active voice to passive where possible, adjust sentence structure for formality, and replace certain adjectives/nouns with their more formal equivalents.\"\n\nBut how to distill this into a single instruction?\n\nLooking back at the outputs:\n\nIn example 3, the original is \"See you tonight.\" The output is \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This is a significant change in structure and tone. The original is an informal greeting, the output is a more formal expression of anticipation. So perhaps the instruction was to transform any informal greetings into more formal statements expressing positive anticipation.\n\nSimilarly, example 1 is a rephrasing using a synonym. Example 4 replaces \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\" Example 2 converts active to passive. Example 5 uses a synonym phrase.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was a mix of multiple transformations, including:\n\n- Converting active to passive voice (example 2),\n- Using synonyms (example 1, 4, 5),\n- Restructuring informal greetings (example 3),\n- Possibly expanding contractions (example 1),\n- Adjusting adjectives or phrases (example 4).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rewrite each input into a more formal version, using appropriate synonyms and grammatical structures, regardless of the original's formality level. For instance:\n\n\"Rewrite each sentence into a more formal version by replacing contractions with full forms, using synonyms for informal expressions, converting active voice to passive where applicable, and restructuring sentences to be more polite and precise.\"\n\nBut to confirm, let's test this hypothesis against the examples:\n\nInput 1: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" This fits: contraction expanded, synonym used.\n\nInput 2: \"I considered many approaches.\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" Here, no contraction, but active to passive. The synonym \"various\" is added, and \"considered\" is converted to passive \"were considered.\" This fits the instruction of formalizing.\n\nInput 3: \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This is a major restructuring to express anticipation formally. So this would align with the instruction to make it more formal.\n\nInput 4: \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" \"whole\" becomes \"entire,\" \"made up\" is replaced with \"fabricated.\" This is a synonym substitution for formal terms.\n\nInput 5: \"Please call once you get there.\" → \"Please call upon your arrival.\" Here, \"once you get there\" is replaced with \"upon your arrival,\" which is a synonym phrase. \"call once\" → \"call upon.\"\n\nThus, the instruction likely involved rewriting each input into a more formal version using various techniques: expanding contractions, replacing informal expressions with synonyms, converting active to passive voice where applicable, restructuring informal greetings into more formal statements, and replacing certain nouns/adjectives with their formal counterparts.\n\nTherefore, the original instruction was something along the lines of:\n\n\"Rewrite each sentence into a more formal version by expanding contractions, replacing informal expressions with their synonyms, converting active voice to passive where appropriate, restructuring informal greetings into polite statements, and adjusting word choices to use more formal terminology.\"\n\nAlternatively, phrased more concisely, perhaps:\n\n\"Convert each input into a more formal and polite version by expanding contractions, replacing casual expressions with synonyms, adjusting grammar for correctness and formality, and rephrasing as needed.\"\n\nThis seems to cover all the transformations observed in the examples. For instance, example 2 uses passive voice, which is part of making it more formal. Example 3 transforms an informal greeting into a statement of anticipation. Example 1 expands \"can't\" to \"cannot\" and uses a synonym. Example 4 substitutes \"entire\" for \"whole\" and \"fabricated\" for \"made up.\" Example 5 replaces \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival.\"\n\nThus, after analyzing each input-output pair and considering possible transformations, the most plausible instruction is the one about rewriting inputs into more formal versions using various linguistic adjustments.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe original instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version** using the following techniques:\n\n1. **Expand Contractions**: Convert phrases like \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate.\"\n2. **Replace Informal Expressions with Synonyms**: \n   - Change \"couldn’t stand\" to \"could not endure,\" \n   - Replace \"made up\" with \"fabricated,\" \n   - Substitute \"whole\" with \"entire.\"\n3. **Convert Active to Passive Voice**: Alter \"I considered many approaches\" to \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n4. **Restructure Informal Greetings**: Turn \"See you tonight.\" into \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n5. **Use Polite Alternatives**: Replace \"call once you get there\" with \"call upon your arrival.\"\n\n**Final Instruction**:  \n\"Rewrite each sentence into a more formal and polite version by expanding contractions, replacing informal expressions with synonyms, converting active voice to passive where appropriate, restructuring informal greetings into statements of anticipation, and adjusting phrasing for politeness.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

Hmm, first, I need to look at each input and output and see what transformation happened. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with the first pair:\nInput: \"I can't stand his temper.\"\nOutput: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n\nWait, the output changed \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate.\" That seems like a synonym replacement. So maybe the instruction was to replace certain words or phrases with their synonyms? But not all outputs do that. Let's check others.\n\nSecond input-output:\nInput: \"Please call once you get there.\"\nOutput: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n\nHere, \"once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival.\" That's another synonym replacement. \"Once\" could mean \"when,\" and \"get there\" might be rephrased as \"arrival.\" Alternatively, maybe it's a more formal way of phrasing. But again, similar pattern.\n\nThird pair:\nInput: \"Thanks for your help.\"\nOutput: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n\nHmm, here the output is completely different. Instead of a simple synonym, it's rephrased into a more formal expression. Maybe the instruction is to convert gratitude expressions into more formal terms?\n\nFourth input-output:\nInput: \"She looks like her sister.\"\nOutput: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n\nAgain, a synonym replacement. \"Looks like\" to \"resembles.\"\n\nFifth input-output:\nInput: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nOutput: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\nWait, here the output replaced \"I met\" with \"whom I met.\" That changes the pronoun from \"I\" to \"whom.\" But why would the instruction require changing the pronoun here? Unless there's a specific rule about using indirect object pronouns or something related to noun clauses. Wait, in the output, the phrase \"I met yesterday\" is turned into \"whom I met yesterday.\" So perhaps the original input had an indirect object (\"the lawyer I met\"), and the output requires changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\"? That would fit if the instruction was to convert reflexive pronouns into objective complements or something else.\n\nPutting this all together, the instruction might involve several transformations. Let's list possible patterns:\n\n1. Synonym Replacement (as in first, third, fourth cases).\n2. Formalizing or rephrasing common phrases (like input 2 to output 2).\n3. Changing possessive structure (though none of the examples show that).\n4. Converting \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" in the fifth case.\n\nBut the fifth example is unique. Let me think. The input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So instead of \"I met,\" we have \"whom I met.\" That seems like changing \"me\" to \"whom,\" but only in the relative clause. Wait, in the relative clause \"I met yesterday,\" changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met.\" So perhaps the instruction was to use the objective case when referring back to the subject in certain contexts?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original instruction was to rewrite the sentence such that \"whom\" is used where a pronoun refers to the subject introduced earlier. But in the fifth example, \"The lawyer\" is the subject, and \"yesterday\" is an adverb. \"I met\" is part of the relative clause modifying \"lawyer.\" So if \"I met\" is the subject of the clause, then the object should be \"whom,\" hence replacing \"I\" with \"whom.\"\n\nThis suggests that the instruction might involve rewriting sentences where a personal pronoun is the subject of a relative clause, requiring the use of \"whom\" instead of \"I.\" But wait, in standard English grammar, the use of \"whom\" is typically in questions and indirect objects. Direct objects can use \"who.\" So if the relative clause is acting as a direct object, then \"whom\" would be required. For example, \"The person whom I met...\" Here, \"whom\" is the object of \"met.\" So perhaps the instruction was to replace \"I met\" with \"whom I met\" when \"I\" is the subject of the relative clause.\n\nSo for example, in the fifth input, \"I met yesterday\" is part of the relative clause \"I met yesterday was helpful.\" If \"I\" is the subject of the relative clause, then the relative pronoun should be \"whom.\" So changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met.\"\n\nNow looking at other examples, do any others involve pronouns? The second example uses \"your arrival\" instead of \"there.\" Not related to pronouns. The third example is gratitude converted to formal expression. The fourth is a synonym. The first is synonym. The second is phrasing change. Fifth is pronoun change.\n\nBut how does this fit into a single instruction? Let's think. If the instruction was to \"convert all instances of 'I met' to 'whom I met' when they introduce a relative clause,\" that would explain the fifth example. But then why don't other examples have such transformations? Because in other examples, the instruction might involve different rules.\n\nLooking back at the second example: \"Please call once you get there.\" Output is \"Please call upon your arrival.\" Here, \"once you get there\" is replaced with \"upon your arrival.\" This could be a formality or using a more formal preposition. So maybe the instruction includes converting casual expressions to more formal alternatives.\n\nThird example: \"Thanks for your help.\" Output is a more formal expression. So perhaps the instruction is to convert informal expressions of thanks into more formal ones.\n\nFirst example: \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate.\" Another synonym.\n\nFourth example: \"looks like\" to \"resembles.\" Another synonym.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to perform multiple transformations depending on context. But that seems too vague. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern where the instruction involves specific substitutions based on certain criteria.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a common element among all outputs. For instance, all outputs seem to either use more formal language, change pronouns, or replace phrases with synonyms. But the fifth example is unique because of the pronoun change.\n\nAnother angle: the instruction might be to rephrase the input into a more grammatically complex version. The fifth input becomes \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Which is more complex. So maybe the instruction was to make the sentence more formal or complex by adding relative clauses with \"whom.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could involve changing possessive structures. Let's check:\n\nFirst input: no possessive. Second: \"your arrival.\" Third: \"your help.\" Fourth: \"her sister.\" Fifth: \"the lawyer I met yesterday...\" No possessive changes here.\n\nAlternatively, changing the voice. For example, passive vs active. But none of the outputs show that.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the instruction was to replace contractions with their expanded forms. First example: \"can't\" to \"cannot.\" But the second example has \"call once you get there\" to \"call upon your arrival.\" Not a contraction issue.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to correct grammatical errors. But all the outputs seem correct. So that's less likely.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to rephrase using different parts of speech. For example, changing verbs to nouns. But looking at the outputs, that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nWait, the fifth example's output uses \"whom,\" which is an objective case pronoun. If the instruction was to ensure that in certain contexts, the objective case is used, then that makes sense. But why only in that case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the sentence into its noun clause equivalent. For example, \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" becomes \"The lawyer [who I met] yesterday was helpful.\" But the output is \"whom I met.\" Wait, no, the output is \"whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the entire phrase \"I met yesterday\" is replaced with \"whom I met yesterday.\"\n\nHmm. So perhaps the instruction was to replace \"I met\" with \"whom I met\" whenever \"I\" is the subject of the relative clause. Because in that case, \"whom\" is the correct relative pronoun.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with the fifth example:\n\nOriginal: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\nRelative clause: \"I met yesterday\" modifies \"lawyer.\"\n\nIf \"I\" is the subject of the relative clause, then the relative pronoun should be \"whom\" because \"met\" is transitive, taking an object. Therefore, the relative pronoun must be \"whom.\"\n\nTherefore, changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met.\"\n\nSo this would fit the fifth example. Now, why isn't this transformation applied to other examples? For example, take the first input: \"I can't stand his temper.\"\n\nIs there a case where \"I\" is the subject of a relative clause here? The output is \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" So perhaps the instruction was to change \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate,\" which is a synonym substitution. But if there were another input where \"I\" is the subject of a relative clause, we might expect \"whom\" instead.\n\nBut let's check if the other examples involve such cases.\n\nTake the fourth input: \"She looks like her sister.\" Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" Again, synonym substitution. If there was a sentence like \"He who looks like him...\" but that's not the case here.\n\nSecond input: \"Please call once you get there.\" Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\" This is a phrasing change, not involving a pronoun subject.\n\nThird input: \"Thanks for your help.\" Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Also a phrasing change.\n\nSo the fifth example is the only one where a pronoun subject is present in the relative clause. Hence, the instruction could be to replace \"I met\" with \"whom I met\" in such cases.\n\nBut why did the friend apply this only to the fifth input? Maybe because in the other examples, the instructions were different. So perhaps the instruction was a combination of different transformations, but the user provided an example where one of them involved replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met.\"\n\nWait, but the problem says that the instruction was given once, and the friend read the instruction and wrote outputs for each input. So the instruction must be a set of rules or a specific task that applies to all inputs. However, the outputs only show the application of certain rules, but perhaps some were missed. But according to the problem statement, the friend followed the instruction for all inputs, producing the outputs. So the instruction must cover all possible cases, but the outputs only show one of the possible transformations applied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to make each input more formal by replacing certain phrases with their more formal counterparts. Let's look again at the examples:\n\n1. \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" – synonym, but maybe formal.\n2. \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\" – more formal phrasing.\n3. \"Thanks for your help\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" – formal.\n4. \"looks like\" → \"resembles\" – synonym.\n5. \"I met\" → \"whom I met\" – grammatical correction (using \"whom\").\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to make the writing more formal by replacing informal phrases with their more formal equivalents, sometimes using synonyms, and correcting certain grammatical structures.\n\nFor example, the instruction might have said: \"Rewrite each sentence to be more formal by replacing common phrases with their formal equivalents, using synonyms where appropriate, and ensuring correct usage of pronouns in relative clauses.\"\n\nIn this case, the fifth example required changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" to use the correct relative pronoun. The second example changed \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival\" for formality. The third example rewrote the gratitude into a more formal expression. The first and fourth were synonym replacements to add formality.\n\nBut let's check if this holds:\n\n- The first input's output uses \"cannot tolerate,\" which is a synonym but also slightly more formal than \"can't stand.\"\n- The second example's output is more formal with \"upon your arrival.\"\n- The third example is a complete rephrasing into formal language.\n- The fourth example is a synonym replacement.\n- The fifth is a grammatical correction.\n\nSo the instruction might have required the friend to perform a combination of tasks: replacing informal phrases with formal ones, using synonyms to make the language more precise, and correcting certain grammatical structures like pronoun use in relative clauses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each sentence into its formal equivalent, which might involve all of the above. For instance, \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate\" (formal), \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival\" (more formal), gratitude to a more formal expression, etc.\n\nBut the key is that the instruction must cover all the transformations observed, even if some are not explicitly stated. Since the fifth example required changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met,\" which involves grammar, while others are synonyms or phrasing changes.\n\nAnother possible angle: looking for a pattern in the outputs. For example:\n\n- Outputs 1-4 are synonyms/phrases; output 5 is a grammatical correction.\nBut the problem states that the instruction was given once, so the friend applied it to all inputs. Therefore, the instruction must include all these aspects.\n\nWait, but maybe the instruction was a series of specific instructions, each tailored to a particular case. But the problem states that the friend read the instruction and wrote outputs for every input. So the instruction must be general enough to cover all inputs, but the outputs only show certain transformations.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's think differently. Perhaps the instruction was to convert each sentence into its formal equivalent, which may involve various transformations like replacing contractions, changing verb tenses, using more formal vocabulary, etc.\n\nLet's analyze each input-output pair under this hypothesis:\n\n1. \"I can't stand his temper.\" → \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Here, \"can't\" is a contraction. Replaced with \"cannot,\" making it more formal. Also, \"stand\" might be considered informal compared to \"tolerate.\"\n\n2. \"Please call once you get there.\" → \"Please call upon your arrival.\" \"Once you get there\" is informal. \"Upon your arrival\" is more formal.\n\n3. \"Thanks for your help.\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" This is a complete rephrasing into a formal gratitude expression.\n\n4. \"She looks like her sister.\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" \"Looks like\" is informal; \"resembles\" is more formal.\n\n5. \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, \"I met\" is replaced with \"whom I met,\" correcting the relative pronoun to \"whom\" when referring to a person being met.\n\nIf the instruction was to make the writing more formal by applying these various changes, then all outputs would fit. Each input is transformed into a more formal version, possibly using synonyms, replacing casual phrases, rephrasing, and correcting grammar.\n\nThus, the instruction might have been something like: \"Convert each sentence into its formal equivalent by replacing contractions, informal expressions, and phrases with their more formal counterparts, using synonyms where appropriate, and ensuring grammatical correctness, particularly with respect to pronoun usage in relative clauses.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been: \"Make each sentence more formal by converting informal expressions to their formal equivalents, replacing contractions with expanded forms, using more elevated vocabulary, and correcting any grammatical issues such as pronoun usage in relative clauses.\"\n\nGiven that the fifth example specifically involves the use of \"whom\" (which is now considered archaic but still correct in certain contexts), the instruction might have emphasized the correction of such grammatical elements.\n\nAnother possibility is that the instruction was to convert all possessives from a possessive noun to a possessive pronoun. For example, \"your help\" to \"you help,\" but none of the outputs show that.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to make each sentence more indirect or polite. For instance, \"Please call once you get there\" becoming \"Please call upon your arrival\" for politeness.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to tell. However, considering the fifth example requires a grammatical correction (changing \"I\" to \"whom\"), and the others involve synonyms/phrasing changes, the most plausible instruction is to make the writing more formal by applying various transformations, including replacing contractions, informal phrases, using synonyms, and correcting grammatical elements like pronoun use in relative clauses.\n\nTherefore, the instruction was likely: \"Rewrite each sentence into a more formal tone by replacing contractions, informal expressions, and phrases with their more formal equivalents, using synonyms where appropriate, and ensuring proper grammatical structure, especially in relative clauses where pronouns should be used correctly.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction given was to **rewrite each sentence into a more formal tone** by applying the following transformations:\n\n1. **Replace contractions with their expanded forms**:  \n   - Example: \"I can't stand...\" → \"I cannot tolerate...\"\n   \n2. **Substitute informal phrases with their formal equivalents**:  \n   - Example: \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\"\n   \n3. **Use synonyms for concise or casual expressions**:  \n   - Example: \"looks like\" → \"resembles\"\n\n4. **Rephrase gratitude into more formal terms**:  \n   - Example: \"Thanks for your help\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated\"\n\n5. **Correct grammatical elements in relative clauses**, particularly **using \"whom\" when the subject is introduced by a relative pronoun**:  \n   - Example: \"I met yesterday\" → \"whom I met yesterday\" (ensuring \"whom\" is used when \"I\" is the subject of the relative clause)\n\nThis comprehensive approach aimed to enhance formality, precision, and grammatical accuracy across all inputs.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

Hmm. So the friend took each input and transformed it into the given outputs. Each output seems to be a more formal or slightly adjusted version of the original input. Let me look at the patterns here.\n\nFirst example: Input \"Please call once you get there.\" became \"Please call upon your arrival.\" The change here is replacing \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\". Both mean the same thing but phrased differently. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase in a more formal way.\n\nSecond input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" became \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" Again, substituting \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish\", maintaining the meaning but using more formal vocabulary.\n\nThird input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" turned into \"Shall I accompany you?\" Here, the question structure changed from \"do you want...\" to a suggestion using \"shall I...\". The original was more tentative, while the output is a more direct offer.\n\nFourth input: \"The whole story was made up.\" became \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Changing \"whole\" to \"entire\" and \"made up\" to \"fabricated\"—both synonyms but more formal terms.\n\nFifth input: \"Thanks for your help.\" became \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" So instead of a simple thanks, the output is a more elaborated expression of gratitude, adding \"much appreciated\" which emphasizes the thanks.\n\nLooking at all these transformations, the instruction likely asks the friend to convert casual expressions into more formal or elegant phrasing. But maybe there's a specific type of transformation required. For instance, changing from a first-person perspective to third-person? Wait, no, in the first example, the input is second person (\"you\"), and the output also uses second person. Similarly, in the second input, first person becomes third? No, both are first person. Third example is first person to second. Fourth is same tense. Fifth is same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into another language and then back, but that seems unlikely because the outputs don't have obvious translation elements. Or perhaps it's about adjusting tone or formality level.\n\nAnother angle: The outputs are more polished versions. For example, replacing contractions (like \"don't\" becomes \"do not\") isn't happening here. Wait, the first example uses \"please call once you get there\" vs. \"call upon your arrival\"—no contraction. Similarly, others don't show contractions. So maybe not about contractions.\n\nLooking at the verbs: In the third example, \"want me to go\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you\". \"Accompany\" is more formal than \"go with\". \"Fabricated\" is more formal than \"made up\". \"Assistance is appreciated\" is a bit more formal than \"thanks\".\n\nAnother pattern: The outputs are more elaborate. The first input's output adds \"upon your\" before arrival. The second adds \"it hard to distinguish\". Third replaces \"want\" with \"Shall I\". Fourth uses \"entire\" instead of \"whole\". Fifth adds \"much appreciated\".\n\nSo maybe the instruction was to rephrase each sentence in a more formal or polite way, possibly expanding phrases into longer, more sophisticated expressions. Alternatively, it could be about transforming questions into offers, like changing \"Do you want...\" to \"Shall I...\".\n\nWait, let's see the third example: original is \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Output is \"Shall I accompany you?\" That seems like turning a request into a suggestion. So maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a polite offer rather than a question asking for permission.\n\nBut then why does the first example turn into a different phrasing but not a question? Hmm. The first example's output is a command (\"Please call...\"), whereas the input is a request (\"Please call once you get there\"). So the output is restating the input as a command or a different expression.\n\nSo maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal version, possibly adjusting the tone, replacing casual expressions with more formal ones, or converting questions into offers.\n\nAnother possible angle: The outputs might be translations into another language, but since they are English phrases, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe they are adaptations into a different style, like poetic, but that seems less likely.\n\nLet me check the fifth example again: \"Thanks for your help.\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" So replacing \"help\" with \"assistance\" and adding \"much appreciated\". So more elevated vocabulary and adding emphasis.\n\nIn the fourth example, \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated\"—same root but more formal.\n\nIn the second example, \"can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish\"—using a more precise and formal verb phrase.\n\nIn the first example, \"once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival\"—replacing a less formal prepositional phrase with a more formal noun phrase.\n\nSo the instruction probably involved taking each input and rephrasing it into a more formal or elegant version, possibly replacing certain words or phrases with their more formal equivalents, adjusting sentence structure, or transforming the tone.\n\nBut what's the common thread here? Let's consider the possible instruction categories:\n\n1. Rewrite in more formal language.\n2. Convert questions into offers.\n3. Adjust phrasing for politeness.\n4. Use more sophisticated vocabulary.\n\nLooking at all examples, it's a mix. For example, the first input's output is a restatement of the same request but in a different phrasing. The third example turns a question into a direct offer. The second example adjusts the wording to be more precise. The fourth and fifth examples replace simpler words with more formal ones.\n\nWait, but the fifth example adds \"much appreciated\" which is an addition rather than a replacement. So maybe the instruction was to enhance the gratitude expression by making it more elaborate, not just replacing the word \"thanks\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to transform the input into a more literary or poetic style. For instance, replacing contractions, using more varied sentence structures, etc. But in the given examples, there are no contractions being used. The outputs seem to maintain similar sentence structures.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the instruction was to make the output more concise. For example, \"Please call once you get there.\" → \"Call when you arrive.\" But the output here is actually longer. Hmm, no.\n\nWait, the third example's output is shorter but adds more words. So maybe not conciseness.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction was to use more formal synonyms. For example, \"difference\" replaced with \"distinguish\", \"made up\" with \"fabricated\", \"assistance\" with \"help\".\n\nIf that's the case, the instruction might have been to replace informal words with their more formal counterparts, regardless of structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to adjust the wording for a specific context, like business communication versus casual conversation. The outputs seem more appropriate for formal settings.\n\nPutting this all together, the most plausible instruction is something like: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal or polite version of the original sentence.\" This would account for the various transformations across different examples: replacing phrases with more formal terms, adjusting sentence structure (like changing a question into an offer), using more elevated vocabulary, and adjusting the overall tone.\n\nAnother possible angle is that the outputs are part of a specific style guide or set of rules, such as replacing contractions, using certain tenses, or avoiding certain words. But none of the examples show that.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to translate the input into another language and then back to English, but that's more complex and the outputs don't seem to follow any clear translation patterns.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could involve adjusting the register from casual to formal. For example, changing \"Hey, want to grab lunch?\" to \"Would you be interested in joining me for lunch?\" but in the given examples, that's not exactly the case.\n\nWait, looking at the third example again: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" So it's changing the perspective from \"do you want...\" to \"shall I...\", which is a shift from asking if they should go to offering to go. So that's a significant structural change.\n\nSimilarly, the first example is replacing \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\"—a structural and lexical change.\n\nThe second example is a substitution of \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n\nThe fourth is replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\".\n\nThe fifth is replacing \"thanks for your help\" with \"Your assistance is much appreciated\".\n\nSo there's a combination of both lexical substitutions (more formal words) and structural changes (like converting questions into offers, restructuring phrases).\n\nTherefore, the instruction was likely: \"Take each input and rephrase it into a more formal and polite version, using appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.\"\n\nAlternatively, if the instruction was more specific, like \"replace informal expressions with formal alternatives,\" but the examples show a mix of both lexical and structural changes.\n\nWait, but in the third example, the structure changes entirely from a question to a statement. So maybe the instruction was broader: rephrase each input into a more refined sentence, regardless of the original structure.\n\nBut the first example didn't change the structure—just the phrasing. The second example changed \"can't tell\" to \"find it hard to distinguish\"—same structure. The third example changed the structure from a question to a command/offering. The fourth changed \"was made up\" to \"was fabricated\" but kept the same structure. The fifth added more words.\n\nSo the key differences are in both wording and structure. Therefore, the instruction must cover both aspects: adjusting vocabulary/formality and possibly restructuring the sentence.\n\nAnother possibility is that the instruction was to translate the input into another language and then back to English, but the outputs don't show any foreign language elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to make the output more suitable for a specific audience, like professionals instead of casual friends.\n\nGiven that all the outputs are more formal or polite, the most comprehensive instruction would be to rephrase each input into a more formal version, possibly adjusting grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure to suit a more polite or professional context.\n\nThus, the instruction was likely: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal and polite version, using appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to the friend was to **rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version**, adjusting vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structure for a refined tone. This involved:\n\n1. **Replacing casual phrases with formal alternatives** (e.g., \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\").\n2. **Enhancing gratitude expressions** (e.g., \"Thanks for your help\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated\").\n3. **Structural modifications** (e.g., converting questions into offers, e.g., \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\").\n4. **Using more sophisticated vocabulary** (e.g., \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up\").\n\nThe goal was to ensure outputs adhered to a higher register of English, suitable for formal contexts. \n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version, enhancing clarity, tone, and sophistication.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

Hmm, first, I need to look at each pair and see what transformation is happening here.\n\nStarting with the first example: Input is \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output is \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" So here, the friend changed \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate.\" That seems like replacing \"stand\" with \"tolerate.\" Maybe the instruction is to replace certain verbs with synonyms or rephrase the sentence in some way.\n\nSecond input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\" Oh, interesting. The original question uses \"want me to go,\" and the output is a more formal \"shall I accompany you.\" So maybe the instruction involves converting questions into suggestions using more formal phrasing or different verb forms. Also, changing \"go with you\" to \"accompany.\"\n\nThird input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" So the friend replaced \"got what you said\" with \"understood you.\" That's a change from past tense to present tense, maybe? Or maybe a more direct expression of understanding.\n\nFourth input: \"See you tonight.\" Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" Here, the friend expanded the casual greeting into a more formal expression of anticipation. So maybe the instruction is to turn casual expressions into polite or formal ones, perhaps even adding more details like looking forward.\n\nFifth input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" This is changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met.\" So replacing the subject-verb order with an object pronoun using \"whom.\" But wait, the input uses \"I met\" (subject-verb), and the output uses \"whom I met,\" which is an object pronoun followed by the verb. That's a case where the instruction might be to convert reflexive pronouns into objective ones, but here it's \"me\" vs. \"whom.\" Hmm, maybe the instruction is to use the full relative clause instead of the noun phrase. Wait, the original is \"The lawyer I met...\" and the output is \"The lawyer whom I met...\" So the friend is adding \"whom\" to make it an embedded clause with the relative pronoun.\n\nNow, putting all these transformations together, what's the common thread? Let's list possible categories for each change:\n\n1. First example: Replaced \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate.\" Could be synonym replacement or rephrasing.\n2. Second example: Converted \"want me to go\" into \"shall I accompany.\" Formal request, possibly changing \"go with\" to \"accompany.\"\n3. Third example: Changed \"got what you said\" to \"understood you.\" Maybe changing past tense to present, or replacing phrasal verbs with simple verbs.\n4. Fourth example: Expanded \"See you\" into \"look forward to meeting you.\" Turning a casual expression into a more formal, longer sentence with anticipation.\n5. Fifth example: Changed \"I met\" to \"whom I met.\" Adding a relative clause with the relative pronoun \"whom\" for specificity.\n\nLooking at all these, perhaps the instruction is to transform each input into a more formal or polite version. Let's check each transformation again under that lens.\n\nFirst input: \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate.\" Both are negative statements, but \"tolerate\" feels more formal than \"stand.\" So synonym replacement, but formalizing the tone.\n\nSecond input: Changing the question from casual to more formal, like asking \"Shall I accompany you?\" instead of \"Do you want me to go with you?\" The phrasing is more about making a suggestion rather than asking permission.\n\nThird input: \"Got what you said\" is a colloquial way of saying \"understood your message.\" So replacing the phrasal verb with a direct verb form (\"understood\") might be part of making it more precise or formal.\n\nFourth input: Converting a casual greeting into a more formal expression of anticipation. So taking a simple phrase and expanding it with more polite language.\n\nFifth input: Adding \"whom\" to make the sentence more specific and less ambiguous. Using \"whom\" adds a layer of formality as well.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be transforming the original sentence into a more formal, polite, or complete version. Now, considering all these, the instruction could be something like \"Polish each sentence to make it more formal and clear by replacing informal expressions with their more refined equivalents.\"\n\nAlternatively, another angle: Each output is a more formal rephrasing. Let's test this hypothesis against each input.\n\nFirst input: Original is informal. Output uses \"cannot tolerate,\" which is more formal. Yes.\n\nSecond input: Original is a simple yes/no question. Output turns it into a more formal \"shall I accompany,\" which is a polite request. Correct.\n\nThird input: Original is informal. \"Understood you\" is more direct. Maybe replacing \"got\" (which is informal) with a more precise verb. Correct.\n\nFourth input: Changing \"See you\" to a longer expression showing eagerness. Correct.\n\nFifth input: Adding \"whom\" to make it a complete clause. Adding formality via \"whom.\"\n\nBut wait, in the fifth example, why \"whom\"? Maybe because \"I met\" is in the past tense, but the relative pronoun \"whom\" is used here. Alternatively, the instruction could be to replace \"I/me\" with the appropriate pronoun in the relative clause, which might be \"whom\" when it's the object of a preposition or verb. However, in the original input, \"I met\" is the subject-verb structure, so the relative clause would require \"who\" as the subject. But the output uses \"whom,\" which is the object form. So that's inconsistent. Unless the instruction is to always use \"whom\" for people, regardless of the clause structure, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, maybe the fifth example is an exception. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different reasoning here.\n\nWait, in the fifth input, the original is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So they added \"whom\" before \"I met.\" But the structure of the relative clause is \"The lawyer [relative clause].\" So \"who I met\" would be correct, since \"who\" is the subject of the relative clause. However, \"whom I met\" would be incorrect unless \"met\" is the object of a preposition. Wait, no. In \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday,\" \"whom\" is the subject of the relative clause. Because the verb is \"was,\" the subject is \"lawyer,\" so the relative pronoun should be \"who.\" Therefore, inserting \"whom\" here is actually an error. Unless there's a mistake in the output. But the problem states that the friend provided the outputs, so perhaps we have to take them as given.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that maybe the fifth example isn't following the same pattern as the others. But the user included it in the list, so perhaps there's another reason. Maybe the instruction is to convert the verb phrase into a relative clause using the relative pronoun based on the original clause structure. For example, if the original has \"I met,\" then the relative clause uses \"whom\" because \"I\" is the subject and \"met\" is the verb. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Let's think: the relative clause is \"whom I met,\" where \"I met\" is the verb phrase. The subject of the relative clause is \"lawyer,\" so the relative pronoun should match that. If the original clause is \"I met the lawyer,\" then the relative pronoun is \"who\" (subject). But here, the clause is \"I met [relative clause].\"\n\nWait, the original is \"The lawyer [I met yesterday] was helpful.\" The relative clause is \"I met yesterday.\" The subject of the main clause is \"lawyer,\" so in the relative clause, \"I\" is the subject of \"met.\" So the relative pronoun should be \"who,\" because the relative clause has a subject \"I.\" Therefore, the correct relative pronoun would be \"who,\" not \"whom.\" But the output uses \"whom,\" which is incorrect. This suggests either that the output is wrong, which is unlikely, or that the instruction is to change \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" regardless of grammatical correctness. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the friend made a mistake in the fifth example, but the problem states that the friend provided the outputs correctly. So perhaps there's another reason. Maybe the instruction was to add \"whom\" after the subject, but that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to convert \"I met\" into \"whom I met\" to make it a relative clause. But why would that happen? Let's think about the original input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the structure is the same except for adding \"whom.\" Maybe the instruction was to add a relative pronoun after the subject. But that doesn't fit with the other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence by adding a relative clause using \"whom\" to specify the lawyer. But why would that be necessary? Unless the original lacks clarity. Wait, the original says \"the lawyer I met,\" which refers to a specific lawyer encountered earlier. Adding \"whom\" might not add anything, but perhaps the instruction was to use a relative pronoun to make it clearer? That doesn't make much sense.\n\nHmm, this fifth example is a bit of a puzzle. Let's set it aside for now and consider the other four. If the instruction is to make each sentence more formal and polite, then the fifth example fits if \"I met\" is changed to \"whom I met\" as part of making it more formal. But in standard English, you wouldn't say \"whom I met\" in that context. It should be \"who I met\" because the relative clause's subject is \"I.\" So maybe the instruction was incorrect, but assuming the problem is correct, perhaps the fifth example is a trick. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to always use \"whom\" for people when it's the object, but here it's the subject. That doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase \"I met\" into \"whom I met\" to demonstrate using the relative pronoun, regardless of the clause structure. But that seems arbitrary. Given that the other examples don't involve such grammar changes, maybe the fifth example is an exception due to a mistake in the output, but the user provided it as correct. So perhaps we need to overlook that and focus on the other patterns.\n\nGiven that the fifth example is inconsistent with the others, perhaps the primary instruction is to make the sentences more formal or polite. Let's check the other examples:\n\nFirst input: \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate.\" More formal.\n\nSecond input: Casual question → formal suggestion.\n\nThird input: \"Got what you said\" → \"understood you.\" Perhaps replacing \"got\" (slang) with \"understood,\" which is clearer.\n\nFourth input: Short greeting → long expression of looking forward.\n\nFifth example: Not sure, but the addition of \"whom\" might be part of formalization.\n\nAssuming the fifth example is correct despite the grammar, perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal version, using more precise vocabulary, longer sentences, and polite language. Thus, the instruction might be something like \"Rewrite each sentence into a more formal or polite version, replacing informal expressions with their refined equivalents and expanding short phrases into more complete and courteous statements.\"\n\nTesting this against the examples:\n\n1. \"Can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" (formal).\n\n2. \"Do you want...\" → \"Shall I...\" (polite request).\n\n3. \"Got what you said\" → \"understood you\" (more direct and precise).\n\n4. \"See you\" → \"look forward to meeting you\" (longer, more polite).\n\n5. \"I met\" → \"whom I met\" (adds formality via relative pronoun, but as mentioned earlier, grammatically incorrect, but perhaps the intended output is to add a relative clause for clarity, though not strictly necessary here).\n\nIf the instruction is about making the sentences more formal and polite, then even the fifth example fits if \"whom I met\" is considered a way to make it more formal, even if grammatically it's not the best choice. Maybe the friend was overcompensating for formality, or perhaps the instruction emphasized using relative clauses wherever possible to make the sentences more elaborate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to turn the original sentences into their passive counterparts or use different structures. But the first example doesn't fit passive, second example's output is not passive. Third input's output is active. Fourth is active but expanded. Fifth is a relative clause change.\n\nAnother angle: Each output is a more complex version of the input. For instance:\n\n1. Original is a single sentence, output adds a negative to make it more precise.\n\n2. Original is a question, output is a suggestion phrased more formally.\n\n3. Original uses \"got,\" output uses \"understood\" (maybe more precise).\n\n4. Original is a greeting, output is an expression of expectation.\n\n5. Original is simple, output adds a relative clause.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to \"Expand each sentence into a more complete and polite form by replacing concise phrases with more detailed and formal expressions.\" That would cover all examples. Let's see:\n\n- Replace \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\" (more formal).\n- Change question into a suggestion (more polite).\n- Replace \"got\" with \"understood\" (more precise).\n- Expand greeting into longer expression (more polite and expressive).\n- Add a relative clause (making the sentence more complex).\n\nThis covers all examples except the fifth one, which adds a relative clause but not necessarily making it more complex (though it does add detail). However, the fifth example seems to be a bit of a stretch, but given the output provided, maybe the instruction was to always add a relative clause, which might not be the case here.\n\nAlternatively, considering all examples, the most likely instruction is to transform each input into a more formal and polite version, possibly by expanding abbreviations or shorthand, replacing informal expressions with more refined ones, rephrasing questions into suggestions, etc. This would encompass all the given examples.\n\nFor instance:\n\n- \"I can't stand his temper\" becomes \"I cannot tolerate his temper\" (replacing \"stand\" with \"tolerate,\" more formal).\n- \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" (changing the mode from asking permission to suggesting action, more polite).\n- \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you\" (using \"understood\" instead of \"got,\" more precise).\n- \"See you tonight\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you tonight\" (turning a casual greeting into an expression of anticipation, more polite and formal).\n- \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful\" becomes \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful\" (adding a relative clause for emphasis, but this is more about making it specific rather than polite. However, \"whom\" might be part of making it more formal, even if grammatically it's not the best choice here.)\n\nAssuming the fifth example is intentional, maybe the instruction was to use the full relative clause with the relative pronoun corresponding to the original subject. But in the input, the original subject is \"I met,\" which refers to \"met the lawyer,\" so the relative pronoun should be \"who\" because \"I\" is the subject of \"met.\" However, the output uses \"whom,\" which is the object form. This discrepancy might indicate that the fifth example is an error, but since it's part of the input-output pairs, we have to work with that.\n\nGiven that the fifth example doesn't fit the same pattern as the others, perhaps it's a separate case, but the majority of examples suggest the instruction is to make each sentence more formal and polite. Therefore, the most plausible instruction is: \"Rewrite each sentence into a more formal and polite version, replacing informal expressions with more refined ones, expanding abbreviations, rephrasing questions into suggestions, and adding details to enhance politeness or clarity.\"\n\nThus, the instruction the friend received was likely to transform each input into a more formal and polite statement by refining vocabulary, restructuring sentences, and enhancing formality through various linguistic adjustments.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to the friend was to **transform each input into a more formal and polite version**. This involved refining vocabulary, restructuring sentences, and enhancing politeness through various linguistic adjustments. Here's how the instruction aligns with each input-output pair:\n\n1. **Original**: \"I can't stand his temper.\"  \n   **Output**: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"  \n   - *Adjustment*: Replaced the informal \"can't stand\" with the more formal \"cannot tolerate.\"\n\n2. **Original**: \"Do you want me to go with you?\"  \n   **Output**: \"Shall I accompany you?\"  \n   - *Adjustment*: Converted a casual question into a polite, formal suggestion using \"shall\" and rephrased \"go with you\" to \"accompany you.\"\n\n3. **Original**: \"I got what you said.\"  \n   **Output**: \"I understood you.\"  \n   - *Adjustment*: Expressed comprehension more precisely by replacing the colloquial \"got\" with the direct \"understood.\"\n\n4. **Original**: \"See you tonight.\"  \n   **Output**: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"  \n   - *Adjustment*: Expanded the casual greeting into a longer, formal expression of anticipation.\n\n5. **Original**: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"  \n   **Output**: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"  \n   - *Adjustment*: Added a relative clause with \"whom\" to emphasize specificity (despite potential grammatical nuance, this aligned with the instruction’s focus on formality).\n\n**Final Instruction**:  \n\"Refine each input into a more formal and polite statement by adjusting vocabulary, restructuring sentences, and emphasizing politeness through phrasing, expansion, and precise language.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

Hmm, first, I need to look at each pair and see what transformation or translation happened. \n\nStarting with the first input-output: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" So here, the structure changed from a question using \"want\" to a suggestion phrased as a question ending with \"accompany\". Also, \"me to go\" was converted into \"accompany you\". Maybe the instruction is about rephrasing questions or suggestions into different grammatical forms.\n\nSecond example: \"Please call once you get there.\" Output is \"Please call upon your arrival.\" So \"once you get there\" was replaced with \"upon your arrival\". That seems like changing the preposition phrase into another expression. Similarly, \"call once\" becomes \"call upon\".\n\nThird input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" Here, the original sentence's negation (\"don't think it's a good idea\") became \"it is suggested that...\" structure. Also, \"do anything right now\" was changed to \"no action should be taken at this stage\". So maybe the instruction is to rephrase statements into passive voice or formal suggestions.\n\nFourth input: \"I considered many approaches.\" Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\" So the active voice \"I considered\" becomes passive voice \"were considered\", and \"many approaches\" becomes \"various approaches\". Also, the word order changes slightly. So perhaps the instruction is to convert active sentences to passive, use more formal language (like \"various\" instead of \"many\"), and maybe restructure the sentence.\n\nFifth input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" So \"whole\" became \"entire\", \"made up\" became \"fabricated\". So perhaps replacing common collocations with their synonyms in more formal terms.\n\nPutting all these transformations together, the original instruction might be asking the friend to rephrase the inputs into a more formal or academic style. Let's check each possible aspect:\n\n1. Question to statement: Not all inputs are questions. First input was a question, but the second input is a request, third is a statement, fourth is a past tense statement, fifth is a statement. So maybe not about converting to statements, but rather adjusting the formality.\n\nLooking at the first pair: \"Do you want...\" vs. \"Shall I...\". The output sounds more formal or polite, as \"Shall I accompany you?\" could be seen as offering to help rather than being direct. The second example uses \"upon your arrival\" which is a more formal/premium phrasing compared to \"once you get there\". Third example turns a negative statement into a suggestion. Fourth example converts active to passive and uses \"various\" instead of \"many\". Fifth uses \"entire\" and \"fabricated\".\n\nSo maybe the instruction is to translate the input into a more formal or passive voice, possibly rephrasing common expressions into more academic or professional terms. Alternatively, it could be about converting imperative or suggestions into similar but more formal structures.\n\nWait, looking at the third input-output: the original is a statement of not thinking something is a good idea, and the output is \"it is suggested that...\", which is a more formal way to present advice or recommendation. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a formal recommendation or suggestion, possibly using \"it is suggested that...\" or similar structures.\n\nBut the first input is a question, and the output is a suggestion. If the instruction is about rephrasing into suggestions, then maybe all outputs need to be in a similar form. But the second input is a request to call, output is also a request phrased as a suggestion. Third is a statement turned into a recommendation. Fourth is a statement converted to passive. Fifth is a statement with synonym substitution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the inputs into a passive voice structure, using more formal vocabulary. Let's check:\n\nFirst input's output uses \"accompany\" (passive) whereas the original is active. Second input's output uses \"upon your arrival\" which might not be passive. Third output uses \"suggested\" (passive). Fourth input's output uses passive voice (\"were considered\"). Fifth input's output uses \"fabricated\" (active verb but in passive sense? \"was fabricated\" is passive).\n\nHmm, not all outputs are passive. Third example: the output starts with \"It is suggested...\", which is a passive construction. Fourth example uses passive. Fifth uses active but in a passive form. First example's output is a question with \"shall I accompany\" (active in voice, but \"accompany\" is a verb in active form). So maybe not about passive voice.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the first example, the input was a question, output is a suggestion. So perhaps the instruction was to convert questions into suggestions. But the second input is not a question. However, the second output is still a suggestion. So maybe not limited to questions.\n\nThird example: changing a negative statement into a suggestion. Fourth example: changing active to passive. Fifth: replacing words with their synonyms. So perhaps the instruction is a combination of multiple tasks. But the user mentioned giving a single instruction and five inputs. So probably all outputs follow the same general pattern.\n\nLooking again at the outputs:\n\n1. Input question → output suggestion (using \"shall I accompany\")\n2. Input instruction to call upon arrival → output phrased as \"please call upon your arrival\"\n3. Input statement → output \"It is suggested that no action...\", so rephrasing into a recommendation.\n4. Input \"I considered...\" → output passive \"various approaches were considered\"\n5. Input \"made up\" → output \"fabricated\"\n\nSo maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or academic style. For instance, converting informal expressions into more formal ones, using passive voice where appropriate, rephrasing common collocations with more sophisticated vocabulary, and turning statements into recommendations or suggestions.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Let's see:\n\n- Convert active voice to passive when applicable.\n- Use more formal vocabulary (e.g., \"entire\" instead of \"whole\", \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up\").\n- Replace certain phrases with more formal equivalents (\"call once you get there\" to \"call upon your arrival\").\n- Transform statements into recommendations (\"don't think it's a good idea\" becomes \"suggested that...\").\n\nAdditionally, for questions like \"Do you want...\", change to a suggestion phrased as a question (\"Shall I accompany you?\").\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to make the output a polite offer or suggestion based on the input. For example, if the input is a request or a question, the output is a corresponding suggestion.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to rephrase the inputs into a style where the subject is omitted or implied, but that doesn't fit all cases.\n\nWait, the third input-output pair shows a transformation from a statement (\"We don't think...\") into a recommendation (\"It is suggested that...\"). So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase any statement into a formal suggestion or recommendation. But why would the first input, which is a question, also become a suggestion? Because in the first case, the output is a suggestion. So maybe the instruction was to convert any input into a polite offer or suggestion, regardless of the original sentence type.\n\nBut then the fourth input is a statement, output becomes passive voice. The fifth input is a statement, output replaces \"made up\" with \"fabricated\". So perhaps the instruction had multiple parts: for some inputs, rephrase into a suggestion, for others, use passive voice, etc. But that seems inconsistent unless there's a pattern.\n\nLooking back at all examples:\n\n1. Input question → output suggestion\n2. Input instruction → output same type (instruction phrased differently)\n3. Input statement → output recommendation\n4. Input statement → output passive\n5. Input statement → output synonym replacement\n\nThis is confusing. How can one instruction cover all these varied transformations?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal version, possibly using \"It is suggested that...\" for recommendations, passive voice for some, synonym replacement, etc. But that seems too vague.\n\nWait, another approach: looking at the outputs, they all start with a capital letter and end with a period, except maybe if there's a different structure, but the examples show periods. Let's check the outputs again:\n\n1. \"Shall I accompany you?\" - starts with capital, ends with question mark?\nWait, the first input was a question, output is also a question. But the original instruction says the friend wrote an output for every input. The user showed input-output pairs where the first input is a question, output is a question; second input is a request, output is a request; third is a statement, output is a recommendation; fourth is a statement, output is passive; fifth is a statement, output is synonym.\n\nSo the outputs vary in sentence structure depending on the input. Therefore, the instruction must have a general guideline but allow variations based on the input type.\n\nBut the user said the instruction was a single instruction. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a formal version, using specific transformations whenever possible. For example, replacing certain verbs, using passive voice, converting statements to suggestions, etc.\n\nLooking at the third output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" This seems like a more formal way to suggest not doing something, perhaps in a professional context. Similarly, the fourth example uses \"various approaches were considered\" which is more passive and formal.\n\nAnother thought: the first output uses \"accompany\" instead of \"go with\", which is a more formal verb. The second output uses \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"once you get there\". The fifth output replaces \"made up\" with \"fabricated\". So maybe the instruction is to replace certain words or phrases with their synonyms in a more formal register.\n\nAdditionally, for the first input, the output is a suggestion phrased as a question, which might be part of a larger instruction to respond with polite offers or suggestions.\n\nPutting all this together, the most likely instruction is: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal version, using appropriate grammar and vocabulary. When possible, convert active voice to passive, replace informal phrases with more formal equivalents, use 'It is suggested that...' for recommendations, and maintain politeness and clarity.\"\n\nBut to confirm, let's see if all outputs fit this instruction:\n\n1. \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\" Using formal vocabulary (\"accompany\" vs \"go with\"), and phrased as a suggestion.\n2. \"Please call once you get there.\" → \"Please call upon your arrival.\" Replaced \"once you get there\" with a more formal phrase, same type of instruction.\n3. \"We don't think it's a good idea...\" → \"It is suggested that...\". Converted a negative statement into a formal recommendation.\n4. \"I considered many approaches.\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" Converted active to passive, used \"various\" instead of \"many\".\n5. \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Replaced \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\".\n\nYes, all outputs align with that general instruction. The key elements are formalizing the language, adjusting grammar (passive voice, suggestion structure), replacing informal vocabulary, and maintaining politeness.\n\nTherefore, the instruction was likely to rephrase each input into a more formal, professional version, using appropriate vocabulary, grammar, and structure such as suggesting alternatives, using passive voice where applicable, and replacing common phrases with more formal alternatives.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe original instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or academic version**, focusing on several key transformations:\n\n1. **Formalize Language**: Use more sophisticated vocabulary (e.g., \"accompany\" instead of \"go with\", \"entire\" instead of \"whole\").\n2. **Adjust Grammar**: \n   - Convert active voice to passive where appropriate (e.g., \"I considered...\" → \"various approaches were considered\").\n   - Rephrase time expressions (e.g., \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\").\n3. **Suggest Recommendations**: Rewrite negative or neutral statements as formal suggestions using phrases like \"it is suggested that...\" (e.g., \"We don’t think it’s a good idea...\" → \"It is suggested that...\").\n4. **Politeness**: Frame requests or offers as polite suggestions (e.g., \"Shall I accompany you?\" from \"Do you want me to...\").\n\nBy applying these guidelines, the friend transformed each input into a more formal, structured, and courteous output.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

So, based on the examples provided, each input has been transformed into an output following some specific rule. My job is to reverse-engineer that rule to determine what the initial instruction might have been.\n\nFirst, let me list out all the input-output pairs again to get a clear picture:\n\n1. Input: She looks like her sister. → Output: She resembles her sister.\n2. Input: I considered many approaches. → Output: Various approaches were considered.\n3. Input: We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now. → Output: It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\n4. Input: Please call once you get there. → Output: Please call upon your arrival.\n5. Input: I got what you said. → Output: I understood you.\n\nHmm, so looking at these transformations, I need to find a common pattern or rule that connects each input to its corresponding output. Let's break down each pair.\n\nStarting with the first example: \"She looks like her sister\" becomes \"She resembles her sister.\" The key change here is replacing \"look\" with \"resemble.\" Both verbs relate to similarity, but \"resemble\" is more formal or perhaps more commonly used in written English than \"look like.\" Wait, but \"look like\" is also correct. However, maybe the instruction was about converting colloquial expressions into more formal or academic language. But \"resemble\" isn't necessarily more formal; both are standard. Maybe it's just swapping a synonym.\n\nLooking at the second input: \"I considered many approaches\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered.\" Here, the original uses \"many,\" and the output replaces it with \"various.\" Similarly, \"approaches\" stays the same, but the sentence structure changes slightly. So the instruction might involve changing the way quantifiers are phrased. For example, \"many\" becomes \"various,\" \"few\" becomes \"several,\" etc.\n\nThird example: The input is a negative statement: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" The output is \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" Here, the transformation is quite substantial. The original statement expresses doubt or reluctance, while the output presents it as a suggestion. The structure changes from first-person to passive voice, indicating a suggestion rather than personal opinion. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase doubts or negative statements into positive suggestions or recommendations.\n\nFourth input: \"Please call once you get there\" becomes \"Please call upon your arrival.\" The key here is replacing \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival.\" Both phrases mean the same thing, but \"upon arrival\" is perhaps more formal or uses a preposition phrase instead of a clause starting with \"once.\" So maybe the instruction was to convert temporal clauses into prepositional phrases or use different prepositions.\n\nFifth input: \"I got what you said.\" becomes \"I understood you.\" Here, the verb \"got\" (meaning understood) is replaced with \"understood,\" and the object \"what you said\" is replaced with \"you.\" So \"got\" is a colloquial form, and \"understood\" is the more standard verb. Additionally, the structure changes from \"I got [information]\" to \"I understood [you].\" This suggests that the instruction might involve converting colloquial language into more formal or standard language, possibly in terms of verb choice and sentence structure.\n\nNow, putting all these patterns together, let's consider possible instructions that could lead to these outputs.\n\nOption 1: Convert informal or conversational language into more formal, standard English. This could include replacing contractions (like \"don't\" to \"is not\"), changing synonyms (\"look like\" to \"resemble\"), adjusting quantifiers (\"many\" to \"various\"), transforming clauses into more formal structures (e.g., \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival\"), and converting phrases like \"got what you said\" to \"understood you.\"\n\nOption 2: Restructure sentences to present suggestions or recommendations. For example, changing from a first-person perspective expressing uncertainty to a passive voice suggesting an action. Like turning \"We don't think...\" into \"It is suggested that...\"\n\nBut wait, the third example is the only one where the entire sentence structure is changed, whereas others are more about replacing words or phrases. So perhaps the primary instruction was to convert informal language (colloquialisms, contractions, etc.) into formal language, but the third example goes beyond that.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to rephrase statements into a more persuasive or professional tone, where doubts or hesitations are turned into suggestions. For example, \"We don't think it's a good idea\" becomes a recommendation (\"It is suggested...\").\n\nLooking back at all the examples:\n\n1. Synonym replacement: look → resemble.\n2. Quantifier change: many → various.\n3. Rewriting from first-person negative to third-person suggestion.\n4. Changing temporal clause to prepositional phrase.\n5. Converting colloquial verb (got) to understood and restructuring subject.\n\nSo perhaps the overall instruction was to translate informal or everyday language into more formal, standard English, especially in terms of avoiding contractions, using more formal verbs, and structuring sentences in a more polite or professional manner. However, the third example is different because it's not just changing words but rephrasing the entire sentence structure.\n\nWait, but the third example is the only one that's not just substituting words. So maybe the instruction was more nuanced: sometimes rewrite for formality, sometimes restructure for suggestion.\n\nAnother angle: The outputs seem to often use more formal or passive constructions. For instance:\n\n- \"It is suggested that no action should be taken\" vs. \"We don't think...\"\n- \"Various approaches were considered\" vs. \"I considered...\"\n- \"Please call upon your arrival\" vs. \"Please call once you get there\"\n\nIn each case, the output uses a passive or more impersonal construction. The first four examples also have outputs that are slightly more formal in phrasing. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal, professional style, possibly using passive voice or more elevated vocabulary.\n\nBut why the third example is a complete rephrasing into a suggestion? Maybe that's a different rule applied when the original expresses hesitation. Let's see: in the input, someone is hesitant (\"We don't think...\"), and the output is a suggestion (\"It is suggested...\"). So perhaps the instruction was to turn expressions of doubt into recommendations. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to apply multiple transformations depending on the context. For example, if the input contains a certain phrase, replace it with another, or if it's a negative statement, rephrase it into a suggestion.\n\nLooking at the fifth input: \"I got what you said.\" The output is \"I understood you.\" So \"got\" is replaced with \"understood,\" and the structure changes from \"I got [what you said]\" to \"I understood [you].\" So \"got\" is colloquial, and \"understood\" is more standard. Also, removing the \"what\" and directly addressing the person.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to replace informal verbs with their more standard counterparts and adjust the sentence structure accordingly. For example:\n\n- Replace \"look like\" with \"resemble.\"\n- Replace \"many\" with \"various.\"\n- Replace \"considered\" (active) with \"were considered\" (passive).\n- Replace \"call once you get there\" with \"call upon your arrival.\"\n- Replace \"got\" with \"understood\" and adjust the sentence structure to focus on the person rather than the information received.\n\nAdditionally, in the third example, the entire sentence structure is altered from a first-person negative to a third-person suggestion. This seems like a more significant transformation. So maybe the instruction was to convert any statement expressing hesitation or negative opinion into a polite recommendation or suggestion. That would explain the third example, where the output is a suggestion instead of a personal opinion.\n\nSo combining all these observations:\n\nThe instruction likely required transforming the input into a more formal or polite phrasing. This included several sub-rules:\n\n1. Replacing informal verbs (e.g., \"look like\" → \"resemble,\" \"got\" → \"understood\").\n2. Adjusting quantifiers (e.g., \"many\" → \"various\").\n3. Changing passive voice (e.g., \"were considered\" instead of \"considered\").\n4. Replacing clauses with prepositional phrases (e.g., \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\").\n5. Restructuring sentences to avoid first-person perspective and express recommendations rather than personal opinions (e.g., turning \"We don't think...\" into \"It is suggested...\").\n\nTherefore, the original instruction was probably something along the lines of: \"Redesign the sentence to be more formal, polite, and structured, replacing informal language with more standard terms, adjusting quantifiers, restructuring clauses, and converting personal opinions into suggestions.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been more specific, like \"Convert each input into a more formal version by replacing certain words and adjusting sentence structure.\"\n\nAnother possible angle: The outputs seem to often start with a subject-verb structure, whereas the inputs can vary. For example, the first output starts with \"She resembles,\" whereas the input starts with \"She looks like.\" So perhaps the instruction was to make the subject-verb more explicit or start the sentence with the subject-verb.\n\nBut in other cases, like the third example, the subject changes from \"We\" to \"It,\" which might indicate a different rule applied when the original is a group statement versus a single-person statement.\n\nWait, in the third example, the input is plural (\"We don't think\") and the output uses \"It is suggested,\" which is third person singular. That's a significant change. So perhaps the instruction includes applying different rules based on the subject. For instance, if the input is in first person plural, rephrase as a suggestion; if it's a single person, use \"she/he\"? But in the first example, \"She looks like her sister\" becomes \"She resembles her sister,\" which keeps the third person. So maybe the rule is different based on context.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might be to convert all sentences into third-person singular, using \"he\" or \"she\" as appropriate, and changing verbs to match. But in the first example, the subject is already third person (\"She\"), so it remains. In the third example, \"We\" becomes \"It,\" which is third person singular. That suggests that maybe whenever the input is in first person plural, it's converted to a suggestion, and other subjects stay the same.\n\nBut that's speculative. Let's think again. The key is to find the underlying instruction that, when followed, produces those outputs.\n\nAlternative approach: Look for the most consistent transformation across all inputs. For example, all outputs use \"It is suggested\" except the first four. So maybe the instruction involved checking if the input expresses a suggestion and replacing it with \"It is suggested...\" if not. But the first four examples don't fit that. Alternatively, the instruction was to rephrase the input into a suggestion regardless of the original, but that doesn't match the first four examples.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction was to convert the input into a suggestion if it's not already one, but only in cases where the original is a negative statement or uncertainty. Like, if the input expresses doubt (\"We don't think...\"), then output the suggestion. Otherwise, perform other transformations.\n\nBut that complicates things. Let's consider that perhaps the instruction was more general: convert the input into a more formal, polite version, which includes multiple steps like those listed earlier. The varying examples require that the instruction covers multiple potential transformations.\n\nGiven that, the most plausible instruction is to redesign the sentence to be more formal, polite, and structured, possibly including:\n\n- Changing verbs to more formal equivalents (e.g., \"resemble\" instead of \"look like\").\n- Adjusting quantifiers (\"many\" to \"various\").\n- Using more formal sentence structures (e.g., passive voice, suggestions instead of first-person opinions).\n- Prepositional phrases over clauses (e.g., \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"once you get there\").\n- Removing contractions and colloquialisms (e.g., \"I got\" → \"I understood you\").\n\nTherefore, the original instruction was likely: \"Your task is to rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version by replacing informal language with standard terms, adjusting quantifiers, restructuring clauses into prepositional phrases, and converting personal opinions or doubts into suggestions or recommendations.\"\n\nThis instruction would cover all the observed transformations in the examples. Let's verify:\n\n1. \"She looks like her sister\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" Here, the verb is replaced with a more formal alternative.\n2. \"I considered many approaches\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" Quantifier adjustment and passive voice.\n3. \"We don't think...\" → \"It is suggested...\" Directly changing the content from a personal opinion to a suggestion.\n4. \"Please call once...\" → \"Please call upon...\" Changing the clause to a prepositional phrase.\n5. \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you.\" Replacing colloquial verb and restructuring.\n\nYes, this instruction explains all the examples. Each step aligns with the given output-input pairs. Therefore, the instruction was to convert informal language into formal, polite phrasing, adjusting quantifiers, restructuring clauses, and rewriting personal opinions into suggestions.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe original instruction was to **reformulate each input into a more formal, polite, and structured version**. Specifically, the task involved:\n\n1. **Replacing informal or casual language**: \n   - E.g., \"look like\" → \"resemble,\" \"got\" → \"understood.\"\n2. **Adjusting quantifiers**: \n   - \"many\" → \"various,\" \"few\" → \"several,\" etc.\n3. **Structural changes**:\n   - Converting temporal clauses (e.g., \"once you get there\") to prepositional phrases (\"upon your arrival\").\n   - Rewriting passive voice for suggestions (e.g., \"it is suggested\" instead of \"we think\").\n4. **Eliminating contractions and colloquialisms**:\n   - Exchanging \"don’t\" with \"is not,\" \"didn’t\" with \"did not,\" etc.\n5. **Rephrasing hesitations into recommendations**:\n   - Transforming first-person uncertainties (e.g., \"We don’t think\") into impersonal suggestions (\"It is recommended...\").\n\nBy applying these transformations, the friend generated the outputs from the inputs through systematic refinement towards clarity, formality, and politeness. \n\n**Final Instruction**:  \n\"Redesign each sentence to enhance formality, clarity, and politeness by replacing informal expressions, adjusting quantifiers, restructuring clauses, and converting personal opinions into neutral or polite recommendations.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

Hmm. So the examples show different kinds of transformations. Let me list them again to see patterns.\n\nFirst example: \"The whole story was made up.\" becomes \"The entire story was fabricated.\" So \"whole\" becomes \"entire,\" \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated.\" So maybe replacing certain words or phrases with their synonyms or more formal counterparts?\n\nSecond input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" becomes \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" Here, the structure changes. The original starts with \"I think,\" but the output uses \"It is my opinion...\" so maybe the instruction is to rephrase first-person statements into third-person or more formal language.\n\nThird input: \"Please call once you get there.\" becomes \"Please call upon your arrival.\" Again, changing \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival.\" Maybe converting temporal expressions into their more formal equivalents, using Latin phrases or formal structures.\n\nFourth input: \"She looks like her sister.\" becomes \"She resembles her sister.\" So \"looks like\" is replaced with \"resembles,\" which is a synonym but perhaps a more formal version.\n\nFifth input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" becomes \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, the prepositional phrase \"I met yesterday\" becomes a relative clause starting with \"whom.\" So changing possessive nouns to relative clauses with whom.\n\nWait, the fifth input has \"I met\" changed to \"whom I met.\" So the structure here is inserting \"whom\" after the noun it refers to. But in the input, \"lawyer I met\" is changed to \"lawyer whom I met.\" So the instruction might be to convert possessive pronouns into relative clauses with 'whom'?\n\nAlternatively, maybe changing reflexive pronouns into objective ones? Or adjusting the placement of modifiers to make the sentence more formal.\n\nLet me check each transformation again.\n\n1. \"whole\" → \"entire\": adjective substitution. Formal vs informal.\n2. \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion\": structural change, more formal.\n3. \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\": temporal expression converted to a more formal phrase.\n4. \"looks like\" → \"resembles\": synonym replacement, similar to first example.\n5. \"I met yesterday\" → \"whom I met\": modifying clause converted from a prepositional phrase to a relative clause with 'whom'.\n\nSo maybe the instruction was to rephrase sentences into a more formal tone, replacing certain phrases, using synonyms, changing the structure, etc. Let me see if there's a common thread.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to use a specific translation or transformation. For example, the fifth input's change from \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" suggests replacing possessive pronouns with relative clauses. But that's only one example. Let's look at others.\n\nIn the fourth example, \"She looks like her sister.\" becomes \"She resembles her sister.\" So \"looks like\" is replaced with \"resembles,\" which is a synonym but also a more formal term. So maybe replacing colloquial expressions with their more formal equivalents.\n\nIn the second example, changing \"I think\" to \"it is my opinion\" shifts the perspective to third person. Similarly, the first example's \"made up\" is replaced with \"fabricated,\" which is a synonym but more formal.\n\nThe third example's \"once you get there\" is changed to \"upon your arrival,\" which is a more formal way to express the same idea. So maybe the instruction was to replace informal expressions with their more formal counterparts.\n\nBut then why does the fifth example change \"I met\" to \"whom I met\"? That's a bit different. Let me think. If the instruction was about replacing pronouns with their objective forms in relative clauses, but \"met\" is not a pronoun. Wait, \"whom\" is the object form of \"who,\" but here it's modifying the noun \"lawyer.\" So the structure is changing the prepositional phrase \"I met yesterday\" (where \"I\" is the subject) into a relative clause starting with \"whom.\" So in the original, the modifier is \"I met yesterday,\" and the output has \"whom I met yesterday.\" So the relative clause now has \"whom\" as the subject. So maybe the instruction is to convert possessive + past tense verbs into relative clauses with \"whom\"?\n\nAlternatively, maybe changing the sentence structure from X did Y to X who Y. Like, replacing \"I met\" (X) with \"whom X met.\"\n\nHmm. Let's check the fifth input's structure. Original: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the difference is that in the output, the relative clause is placed before the noun. So instead of \"I met the lawyer yesterday,\" it's \"the lawyer whom I met yesterday.\"\n\nSo maybe the instruction was to convert prepositional phrases referring to the subject into relative clauses starting with \"whom.\" But why would that be the case? Maybe the input had sentences where the modifier was a prepositional phrase referring to the subject, and the output requires changing that into a relative clause.\n\nLooking at all examples, the fifth one seems to fit that. But why does the second example involve changing \"I think\" to \"it is my opinion\"? That's a structural change, not just a clause. So perhaps the instruction had multiple components. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase each sentence by replacing certain collocations, converting first-person to third-person, and converting some phrases into more formal terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal version using specific substitutions. For instance:\n\n- Replace \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\"\n- Replace \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion.\"\n- Replace \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival.\"\n- Replace \"looks like\" with \"resembles.\"\n- Convert possessive + past tense verb to relative clause with \"whom.\"\n\nBut how do these substitutions tie together? Is there a common thread? Let's see. The first four examples all seem to involve replacing parts of speech or phrases. The fifth involves restructuring the sentence. So maybe the overall instruction was to formalize the input by making it more objective, using more formal vocabulary, and restructuring when necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input in a way that replaces certain idiomatic expressions with their more formal counterparts. For example, \"made up\" is informal, replaced with \"fabricated.\" \"I think\" is replaced with \"It is my opinion,\" which is more formal. \"Once you get there\" is replaced with \"upon your arrival,\" which is a more formal way to say it. \"Looks like\" becomes \"resembles,\" a synonym. And \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met,\" changing the structure.\n\nWait, but \"I met\" is a simple past, and the output is \"whom I met.\" So \"I met\" is turned into \"whom\" followed by the rest. So perhaps the instruction was to convert possessive personal pronouns into relative clauses with \"whom,\" but that only applies to the fifth example. So that doesn't cover all cases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to adjust the sentence structure to be more objective. For instance, replacing \"I think\" with \"it is my opinion\" makes the statement more objective. Similarly, replacing \"please call once you get there\" with \"call upon your arrival\" is a more formal way. Replacing \"looks like\" with \"resembles\" is a synonym replacement. Changing \"whole story\" to \"entire story\" is adjectival. Changing \"was helpful\" to \"was helpful\" (same here). Wait, the fifth example's output is the same as the input except for adding \"whom.\"\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input according to specific rules: replacing certain phrases, converting first-person to third-person, changing verb tenses or forms, etc.\n\nWait, let's look at all transformations:\n\n1. Adjective substitution: \"whole\" → \"entire\"; \"made up\" → \"fabricated.\"\n2. Structural change: \"I think...\" → \"It is my opinion...\"\n3. Phrase substitution: \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\"; \"looks like\" → \"resembles.\"\n4. Pronoun replacement in relative clause: \"I met\" → \"whom I met.\"\n\nSo combining these, maybe the instruction was a combination of multiple tasks:\n\n- Replace \"made up\" with \"fabricated\" (adjective synonym).\n- Replace \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion\" (structural change, third-person).\n- Replace \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\" (phrase substitution).\n- Replace \"looks like\" with \"resembles\" (synonym).\n- Convert \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" (relative clause).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was more general, like \"make each output sentence more formal by replacing certain phrases and structures.\" But the examples show different types of changes. However, the fifth example stands out because it's the only one that changes the structure beyond substituting words.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to convert the sentence into a relative clause whenever possible. For example, the fifth input had a prepositional phrase \"I met yesterday,\" which became \"whom I met yesterday.\" But that only applies to one example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace certain pronouns with their object forms in relative clauses. For instance, changing \"I met the lawyer\" to \"the lawyer whom I met.\"\n\nBut why only the fifth input? Unless the instruction was to modify any instance where \"I met\" appears in that format. But the inputs are standalone sentences, not necessarily containing \"I met.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to turn all possessives into relative clauses with \"whom.\" But again, that's only applicable to the fifth input.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. What's common between all outputs? They all seem to make the sentence more formal or objective. The first four examples replace less formal phrases with more formal ones, while the fifth changes the structure. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version, using appropriate substitutions and/or restructuring.\n\nBut how can we generalize this into an instruction? Perhaps the instruction was something like: \"Convert each input into a more formal sentence by replacing idiomatic expressions with their formal equivalents, using third-person perspective when necessary, and restructuring sentences where appropriate.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to perform specific translations based on a predefined list of mappings. For example:\n\n- \"made up\" → \"fabricated\"\n- \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion\"\n- \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\"\n- \"looks like\" → \"resembles\"\n- \"I met\" → \"whom I met\"\n\nIf that's the case, then the instruction would have listed all these specific replacements. But since the instruction is likely to be a single coherent set of instructions, maybe there's a pattern connecting all these.\n\nWait, looking at all examples, the first four transformations are replacing or modifying specific phrases, and the fifth is restructuring. Perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input by replacing common phrases with their more formal versions, sometimes restructuring the sentence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a passive voice, but none of the outputs are in passive. For example, \"was made up\" instead of \"made up.\" But the first output is \"The entire story was fabricated,\" which uses active voice with \"fabricated.\" So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to change the subject of the sentence. For example, the second output says \"It is my opinion,\" so changing \"I\" to \"it is my opinion.\" But the first example didn't follow that unless it's a general rule.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction was to convert the sentence into a third-person perspective when possible. For example, changing \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion,\" which is a third-person perspective. The first output is in the same person (\"The entire story was fabricated\") as the input (\"The whole story was made up\"). So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's try to think of the instruction as a set of steps:\n\n1. For \"made up,\" use \"fabricated.\"\n2. Replace \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion.\"\n3. Replace \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival.\"\n4. Replace \"looks like\" with \"resembles.\"\n5. Replace \"I met\" with \"whom I met.\"\n\nIf that's the case, then the instruction would specify each of these mappings. However, the fifth mapping isn't a direct word substitution but a restructuring. So perhaps the instruction was more general: for any occurrence of \"I met [someone] [when/where],\" replace it with \"the [someone] whom I met [there/then].\"\n\nBut how does that fit with the other examples? The other examples are about replacing phrases or changing structure. Unless the instruction was to formalize each sentence by using more formal vocabulary and restructuring where needed.\n\nAnother angle: the fifth output adds \"whom,\" which is the object form of \"who.\" So replacing \"I met\" (first-person possessive) with \"whom\" (objective form) in the relative clause. So maybe the instruction was to convert possessive + past tense verbs into relative clauses with \"whom.\"\n\nBut this only applies to the fifth input. So perhaps the instruction was to modify any instance where \"I\" is followed by a past tense verb and a prepositional phrase into a relative clause with \"whom.\"\n\nFor example, \"I saw a man\" → \"a man whom I saw.\" But in the fifth example, the structure is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met.\" So maybe the instruction was to replace \"I met\" with \"whom I met\" to form a relative clause.\n\nBut why only in this case? The other examples don't involve similar structures. The third example changes \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival,\" which is a phrasal replacement. So perhaps the instruction was a combination of multiple steps, each applicable to certain cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to make the output sentence more formal by replacing certain phrases, sometimes converting them into relative clauses, and sometimes changing the perspective (like replacing \"I think\" with \"it is my opinion\").\n\nBut how to tie all these into a single instruction? Maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input sentence into a more formal version, using third-person perspective whenever possible, replacing informal expressions with their more formal counterparts, and structuring the sentence to avoid first-person pronouns where appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to translate the input into its passive voice equivalent. Let's check:\n\nInput 1: \"The whole story was made up.\" Passive: \"The entire story was made up.\" Output is \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Which is different; passive voice uses the past participle, but the output uses \"fabricated,\" which is similar but not exactly passive. So that doesn't match.\n\nAnother thought: the fifth output uses \"whom,\" which is the objective case of \"who,\" while the input used \"I met.\" So replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met\" changes the subject from first-person to third-person. That could be part of a general rule of making the sentence more formal by removing first-person references.\n\nSimilarly, the second output removes \"I\" and adds \"my opinion,\" which is a third-person perspective.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to rewrite each input into a more formal version by:\n\n- Replacing first-person pronouns with third-person constructions (like \"it is my opinion\" for \"I think\").\n- Converting prepositional phrases like \"I met yesterday\" into relative clauses with \"whom\" (making it third-person, objective case).\n- Replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents (e.g., \"made up\" → \"fabricated\", \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\", \"looks like\" → \"resembles\").\n\nPutting this all together, the instruction could be something along the lines of: \"Formalize each sentence by rewriting it to use third-person perspective, replacing informal phrases with more formal alternatives, and converting certain phrases into relative clauses with 'whom'.\"\n\nBut to test this hypothesis, let's apply it to the examples:\n\n1. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\"  \n   Formalization steps: Replace \"was made up\" with \"was fabricated\" (more formal), keep \"whole\" as \"entire\" if that's the intended formal equivalent. Output matches.\n\n2. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\"  \n   Steps: Remove \"I think\" and replace with \"It is my opinion,\" leading to the output.\n\n3. Input: \"Please call once you get there.\"  \n   Replace \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival,\" which is a more formal version. Output matches.\n\n4. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\"  \n   Replace \"looks like\" with \"resembles,\" which is a synonym and more formal. Output matches.\n\n5. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"  \n   Convert \"I met\" to \"whom I met,\" turning \"I\" into \"whom\" (third-person objective case), thus removing first-person reference. Output matches.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the instruction was to formalize the input sentences by replacing certain phrases with more formal equivalents, converting first-person pronouns to third-person constructions where necessary (like using \"my opinion\" instead of \"I think\"), and restructuring phrases like \"I met\" into relative clauses with \"whom\" to remove first-person references.\n\nTherefore, the likely instruction was: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal sentence by replacing informal phrases with their more formal counterparts, converting first-person references to third-person constructions (like replacing 'I think' with 'It is my opinion'), and restructuring phrases like 'I met' into relative clauses using 'whom' to avoid first-person pronouns.\"\n\nAlternatively, a shorter instruction might be: \"Convert each sentence to a more formal version by replacing 'I think' with 'It is my opinion', replacing 'made up' with 'fabricated', changing 'once you get there' to 'upon your arrival', substituting 'looks like' with 'resembles', and converting 'I met' to 'whom I met'.\"\n\nBut the key here is identifying that the instruction involved multiple transformations, possibly including several types of replacements and restructuring to achieve a more formal tone.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction required transforming each input into a more formal version through a combination of substitutions, rephrasing, and structural adjustments. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### Instruction:\n\"Rewrite each sentence into a more formal version by applying the following rules:\"\n1. **Replace Informal Phrases**:  \n   - Substitute \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\"  \n   - Replace \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion.\"  \n   - Change \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival.\"  \n   - Replace \"looks like\" with \"resembles.\"  \n\n2. **Restructure Sentences to Avoid First-Person References**:  \n   - Convert \"I met\" into \"whom I met\" to use the objective case \"whom\" instead of \"I,\" aligning with third-person construction.  \n\n### Example Transformations:\n- **Input",

Hmm, so the friend took five different inputs and produced corresponding outputs. Let me look at each pair and see if there's a pattern or transformation rule.\n\nStarting with the first example: Input is \"She looks like her sister.\" Output is \"She resembles her sister.\" So here, the verb \"looks like\" has been replaced with \"resembles.\" Maybe the instruction was to replace certain verbs with synonyms? But wait, in the second input, \"See you tonight.\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" That's not a synonym substitution. Instead, it's rephrasing the expression into a more formal version. Interesting. \n\nThird input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Output is \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Here, \"whole\" became \"entire,\" and \"made up\" became \"fabricated.\" Another synonym replacement maybe? Let's check the next ones. Fourth input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" So the phrase \"can't tell the difference\" was turned into \"find it hard to distinguish.\" Again, a paraphrasing change rather than direct synonym replacement. Fifth input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" This seems more complex. The original is a negative statement about not thinking it's a good idea, but the output is a positive suggestion. So here, the approach might involve changing the perspective from \"not doing something\" to a recommendation against it. \n\nSo, looking at all examples, some use synonym substitution (like 'looks' to 'resembles', 'whole' to 'entire'), but others involve rephrasing entire phrases into more formal or constructive suggestions. Let's list possible instruction categories:\n\n1. **Synonym Replacement**: Replace specific words with their synonyms. For example, \"look like\" → \"resemble,\" \"whole\" → \"entire,\" \"made up\" → \"fabricated.\"\n2. **Formal Rephrasing**: Convert casual expressions into more polite or professional phrasing. Like \"See you\" → \"look forward to meeting,\" \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find hard to distinguish.\"\n3. **Constructive Feedback**: Transform statements of non-action into recommendations. For instance, \"don't think it's a good idea\" → \"suggested no action.\"\n\nNow, checking which of these fits best. The first three examples seem to fit synonym replacement. The fourth and fifth require more than just synonyms; they involve rephrasing or shifting perspective. However, perhaps the instruction is a combination of both? But maybe there's a single underlying instruction that covers multiple transformations.\n\nLet me think again. If the instruction was to translate informal or slang expressions into more standard language, then examples 1-4 could fit. But the fifth example seems like more than just translation. Alternatively, the instruction could be to convert certain phrases into formal recommendations, regardless of the input type. Wait, but the third input is about \"was made up,\" which is a synonym replacement, while the fifth is a complete restructuring. Maybe the instruction is to generate a counter-proposal when someone suggests inaction, like turning a negative into a positive recommendation. But how does that apply to the other inputs?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to make the sentence more formal or professional. The second input's \"See you\" becomes a more formal expression. The fourth input's \"can't tell the difference\" becomes a more nuanced phrasing. The fifth input is transformed into a recommendation. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more polite, professional tone, possibly avoiding negative statements and offering constructive alternatives where applicable.\n\nBut looking at the third input, \"The whole story was made up.\" Output is \"The entire story was fabricated.\" That's a synonym substitution. So maybe the instruction includes replacing specific words with their synonyms where possible, but also including phrasing changes for more formal tone. For example, replacing \"made up\" with \"fabricated\" as synonyms, and \"whole\" with \"entire,\" but also handling phrases like \"can't tell the difference\" into \"find it hard to distinguish.\"\n\nWait, the first four outputs are all rephrasing with synonyms or slightly different wording. The fifth is a bit more complex. Let's see:\n\nOriginal: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" Here, the original negative (\"don't think it's a good idea\") is turned into a positive suggestion (\"It is suggested...\"). So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a formal recommendation against taking action, even if the original suggests inaction. That would explain the fifth input. But why does the fourth input get a similar treatment? The fourth input is a statement of fact: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" The output is a paraphrase expressing difficulty, but not a recommendation. So that doesn't align with the fifth example's structure.\n\nHmm, perhaps the instruction is more nuanced. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the outputs, many seem to shift from a first-person perspective to a more objective or formal one. For example, \"See you tonight\" becomes \"I look forward to...\" which shifts from future plans to expressing anticipation. Similarly, \"I can't tell the difference\" becomes \"I find it hard to distinguish,\" which is a more formal way of saying the same thing. The third input's \"made up\" is a synonym. The first input's \"looks like\" becomes \"resembles,\" which is a synonym. The fifth input's transformation seems different—it's converting a statement of non-action into a suggestion to avoid action, which could be seen as a form of constructive feedback.\n\nBut how to reconcile all these? Maybe the instruction was to take the input and either replace certain words with synonyms, rephrase for a more formal tone, or suggest alternative actions where possible. However, the fifth input's case involves restructuring the entire sentence into a positive recommendation, which isn't a direct synonym replacement. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to turn any statement suggesting inaction into a recommendation against taking action, while handling synonyms and formalizing others. But that seems too specific, especially since the other examples don't fit that pattern. \n\nAnother angle: The outputs often have a certain structure. For example, the second output is a clause starting with \"I look forward...\" which is a common expression for saying \"I hope to meet you soon.\" Similarly, the fifth output starts with \"It is suggested that...\" which is a formal phrasing used in recommendations. Maybe the instruction was to convert expressions of future intent or non-action into more formal or professional language, using certain stock phrases.\n\nWait, looking at the second input's output: \"See you tonight.\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" So it's a generalization from plans to express anticipation. The fourth input's output is \"I find it hard to distinguish between them,\" which is another way of saying \"I can't tell the difference,\" but phrased more formally. The first input's \"resembles\" instead of \"looks like\" is a synonym. Third input's \"entire\" and \"fabricated\" synonyms. Fifth input's complete restructuring into a recommendation.\n\nPutting this together, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite tone, using certain stock phrases depending on the context. For example:\n\n- When the input expresses a plan (\"See you\"), rephrase as expressing anticipation.\n- When the input is about perception (\"can't tell the difference\"), rephrase as expressing difficulty.\n- When the input mentions making something up, replace with synonyms.\n- When the input discusses non-action or suggestions, rephrase into a positive recommendation.\n\nBut the fifth input's output doesn't fit that exact pattern. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to create a counter-proposal when someone suggests inaction, turning negatives into positives. For example, the fifth input is transformed into a suggestion to avoid action, which is a direct opposite of the original thought. But the fourth input's output doesn't follow that. \n\nWait, the fourth input's original is \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" The output is \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" So that's a synonym replacement for \"can't tell the difference\" but doesn't add a recommendation. So that complicates things.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider each output and see what the instruction could be that would generate them from the inputs.\n\n1. Input: She looks like her sister. Output: She resembles her sister. → Replacing \"looks like\" with \"resembles.\"\n\n2. Input: See you tonight. Output: I look forward to meeting you tonight. → Rephrasing the greeting into a formal expression of anticipation.\n\n3. Input: The whole story was made up. Output: The entire story was fabricated. → Synonym replacement.\n\n4. Input: I can't tell the difference between these two. Output: I find it hard to distinguish between them. → Replacing \"can't tell the difference\" with a synonym phrase.\n\n5. Input: We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now. Output: It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage. → Reversing the original statement into a positive suggestion, using formal phrasing.\n\nSo the instruction seems to cover multiple types of transformations. However, the key commonality could be that the output is a more formal or constructive version of the input, possibly replacing certain verbs or phrases with synonyms or stock phrases, while in some cases restructuring the entire sentence into a recommendation against inaction.\n\nAlternatively, considering the outputs, the instruction might have been to convert the input into a more polite or professional expression, using specific constructions. For example, using \"resemble\" instead of \"look like,\" \"look forward to\" instead of \"see you,\" etc. Also, replacing \"made up\" with \"fabricated,\" which is a synonym but more formal. The fourth output uses \"find it hard to distinguish,\" which is another way to say the same thing but more formal.\n\nThe fifth input's output is particularly about transforming a statement of inaction into a recommendation, which might suggest that the instruction was to generate a counter-proposal when someone suggests not doing something. But why does the first input become a synonym and not a recommendation? Unless that's just part of the same process.\n\nWait, the first input's output is a synonym. The second is a greeting rephrased into a form of expectation. The third is a synonym. The fourth is a synonym phrase. The fifth is a recommendation. So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or positive alternative, using different strategies depending on the input type. However, this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace certain phrases with more formal equivalents. For example:\n\n- Replace \"look like\" with \"resemble.\"\n- Replace \"see you\" with \"look forward to meeting you.\"\n- Replace \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\"\n- Replace \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish.\"\n- Replace \"don't think it's a good idea\" with \"suggest no action should be taken.\"\n\nBut the fifth input's output seems like it's not just replacing a phrase but completely restructuring the sentence into a recommendation. So perhaps the instruction had multiple parts. For example, when the input suggests not doing something, rephrase it into a recommendation against doing it. But why does the fourth input, which is a statement of inability to differentiate, result in a similar rephrasing?\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to generate a response that is the opposite of the input's meaning. But that seems unlikely because the third input's output is a synonym. The fifth input's output is the opposite in a way (saying no action should be taken instead of not thinking it's a good idea), but the fourth input's output doesn't oppose the original meaning. So that theory doesn't hold.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a more formal, less direct way of communicating. For example:\n\n- Greetings: \"See you\" becomes a more formal expression of looking forward to a meeting.\n- Statements of observation: \"looks like\" → \"resembles.\"\n- Expressions of uncertainty: \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish.\"\n- Suggestions of inaction: \"don't think it's a good idea\" → \"suggested no action should be taken.\"\n\nIn this case, the instruction could be to rephrase the input into a more formal or indirect communication style, using appropriate phrases. However, the fifth example's output doesn't fit this pattern, as it's a recommendation against action, whereas the original suggests inaction. Wait, actually the original says \"don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now,\" which implies hesitation, but the output is a suggestion to not take action, which is actually aligned with the original thought. Wait, maybe the output is a restatement of the original idea in a different way. But the original is a tentative opinion, while the output is a more definitive suggestion. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to generate a counter-suggestion when someone expresses hesitation. For example, if the input is hesitant (\"I don't know\"), the output could be a stronger recommendation. But again, the fifth example's output doesn't fit that pattern. \n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to think of possible instructions that could generate all these outputs.\n\nPossibility 1: The instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version, using specific transformations:\n\n- Replace \"look like\" with \"resemble.\"\n- Replace \"see you\" with \"I look forward to meeting you.\"\n- Replace \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\"\n- Replace \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish.\"\n- For the last input, replace \"don't think it's a good idea\" with \"it is suggested that no action should be taken.\"\n\nBut why does the fifth input's output start with \"It is suggested that...\" which is a specific phrasing used in formal writing. Maybe the instruction included using such phrasing for recommendations. So perhaps whenever the input implies hesitation or suggests not doing something, the output should state a recommendation using formal language.\n\nBut then the fourth input, which is a statement of inability to differentiate, ends up with a similar phrasing. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal version, using \"I look forward to...\" for greetings, \"resemble\" for \"look like,\" etc., and for recommendations, use \"suggested no action should be taken\" type phrasing. However, this only accounts for the last example. The fifth input's output is generated from a different type of input.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to translate the input into another language, but none of the outputs seem to be translations. For example, \"See you\" in French is \"Au revoir,\" but the output is \"I look forward to meeting you,\" which doesn't match. So that's probably not it.\n\nAnother thought: The outputs often end with \"should be\" or similar, but the fifth input's output is \"should be taken.\" The others don't have such endings. So maybe the instruction was to add a suggestion or recommendation where the input implies hesitation.\n\nBut this still doesn't explain all examples. The first four examples don't have such endings. The third example's output is just a synonym.\n\nWait, looking back at the fifth input/output:\n\nInput: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n\nSo here, the input is a tentative opinion (\"don't think it's a good idea\"), and the output is a formal suggestion against taking action. Perhaps the instruction was to rephrase such statements into a more definite recommendation, using specific formal phrasing.\n\nBut why does the second input get rephrased into a greeting? Maybe the instruction was to handle different types of inputs differently. For example:\n\n- If the input is a greeting, rephrase it into \"I look forward to...\" \n- If it's a similarity statement, replace with \"resemble.\"\n- If it's a fabrication claim, use \"fabricated.\"\n- If it's a perception statement, rephrase.\n- If it's a hesitation about action, rephrase into a recommendation.\n\nBut that would mean varying instructions depending on the input type. However, the user probably provided a single instruction, not multiple. So that's unlikely.\n\nWait, the problem states that the instruction was given once, and the friend applied it to all inputs. So there must be a single underlying instruction that explains all outputs. Let's think again.\n\nLooking at all outputs:\n\n1. Synonym replacement (\"looks like\" → \"resembles\")\n2. Formal greeting (\"see you\" → \"look forward\")\n3. Synonym replacement (\"whole\" → \"entire\", \"made up\" → \"fabricated\")\n4. Synonym replacement (\"can't tell\" → \"find hard to distinguish\")\n5. Restructured into a recommendation (\"don't think it's a good idea\" → \"suggest no action\")\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to:\n\n- Replace certain common expressions with their synonyms or more formal counterparts, and in cases where the input suggests not taking action, rephrase it into a recommendation against taking action using formal language.\n\nBut this is quite broad. Alternatively, the instruction could have been to \"rephrase the input into a more formal and constructive statement, using synonyms where possible and restating suggestions as recommendations where appropriate.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to convert the input into a more polite or professional version by replacing informal terms with more formal alternatives, sometimes rephrasing entirely, and in cases where the input implies inaction, turning it into a recommendation to avoid action.\n\nBut the key seems to be combining synonym replacement with phrasing changes for formality and recommendations. However, without more examples, it's hard to pinpoint. But given the fifth example, which is a complete rephrasing into a recommendation, and the others being partial rephrasings or synonyms, maybe the instruction was specifically to take the input and either:\n\n- Replace certain phrases with synonyms, making the language more formal,\n- Or, when the input suggests not doing something, rephrase it into a recommendation against doing it (using formal phrasing).\n\nBut the second input doesn't suggest not doing something, yet it's rephrased. So that complicates it. Maybe the instruction was more general—rephrase any input into a formal or polite version, regardless of content.\n\nFor instance, \"See you\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you,\" which is a more formal way of expressing the same idea. Similarly, \"made up\" is replaced with \"fabricated,\" which is a synonym but more formal. \"Can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find hard to distinguish,\" another rephrasing. The first input's \"resembles\" is a synonym. The fifth input's output is a recommendation phrased formally.\n\nSo putting it all together, the instruction was likely to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly using specific transformations like synonym replacement, rephrasing expressions of plans, and turning negative suggestions into positive recommendations. However, the fifth example's output doesn't fit into the negative suggestion category but still requires a recommendation. Therefore, the instruction must cover multiple cases.\n\nGiven that, the most probable instruction is:\n\n**Instruction:** Rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, using synonyms where possible and restating suggestions as recommendations where appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, since the fifth input's output",

The user provided five input-output pairs where a friend transformed each input into an output according to some rule. My job is to reverse-engineer that rule to find the instruction.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the input-output pairs again to see patterns:\n\n1. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n2. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n3. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n4. Input: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\"\n5. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\nLet me start by looking at each pair to see possible transformations.\n\n**First Pair:** Input is a question starting with \"Do you...\" and the output is a more formal or polite rephrasing using \"Shall I...\" So maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a polite suggestion? But let's check other pairs.\n\n**Second Pair:** Input is a thank you, output is a more elaborate version. So perhaps converting \"thank you\" expressions into more formal ones. But in this case, \"Thanks for your help\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" So it's expanding \"help\" to \"assistance\" and adding \"much appreciated\" to make it more formal. Wait, but sometimes \"thanks\" can be converted to \"appreciate\" in such contexts. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase gratitude in a more formal way by replacing \"thanks\" with \"appreciate\" and adjusting the sentence structure.\n\n**Third Pair:** Input uses \"can't stand\" which is informal, output replaces it with \"cannot tolerate\". So here, the instruction might involve converting informal expressions to their formal equivalents. \"Can't stand\" → \"Cannot tolerate\". That makes sense. Are there other examples where informal phrases are converted to formal? Let's see.\n\n**Fourth Pair:** Input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" Here, the output restructures the sentence from \"I got what you said\" to \"I understood you\". So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more concise or different structure while retaining the meaning.\n\n**Fifth Pair:** Input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output adds \"whom\" before \"I met yesterday\". So changing \"I met yesterday\" to \"whom I met yesterday\". This seems like inserting a relative pronoun to make it more formal or grammatically correct. Wait, in the original input, \"I met yesterday\" is a noun phrase modifying \"lawyer\". The output adds \"whom\" to introduce the relative clause properly. So perhaps the instruction was to add the appropriate relative pronoun when needed.\n\nNow, let's look for common threads across all these transformations:\n\n1. Formalizing the language (like changing \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\", \"help\" to \"assistance\").\n2. Replacing informal expressions with more polite or formal phrasing (\"Do you...\" to \"Shall I...\"; \"Thanks...\" to \"Your assistance...\").\n3. Restructuring sentences for clarity or formality (e.g., \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\").\n4. Inserting relative pronouns to complete relative clauses when necessary (adding \"whom\" to \"I met yesterday\").\n\nBut the first four examples seem to focus on transforming questions into polite requests, thanks into formal expressions, negative statements into negatives with \"tolerate\", and rephrasing \"got what you said\" into \"understood you\".\n\nThe fifth example is about inserting a relative pronoun to make the clause grammatically correct.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version, possibly by making the sentences more grammatically correct (like inserting relative pronouns), adjusting the verb forms, and replacing informal expressions with more formal ones.\n\nBut wait, let's check the second example again: \"Thanks for your help.\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" So here, \"help\" is turned into \"assistance\" and \"much appreciated\" is added. Similarly, \"got what you said\" becomes \"understood you.\" These might be instances where expressing gratitude is being transformed into a more formal expression, possibly using different vocabulary.\n\nSimilarly, \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate,\" which is a more formal way of expressing dislike.\n\nIn the first example, the input is a question starting with \"Do you...\", which is then rephrased as \"Shall I...\". This could be converting the input into a polite suggestion or offer.\n\nLooking at all these transformations, the instruction might be to rephrase the given sentence into a more formal, polite, or grammatically correct version. However, the fifth example specifically adds the relative pronoun, which isn't covered by just formalizing.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to \"convert informal expressions to their more formal equivalents\" with additional context or rules. Let's think about each input-output pair and see if there's a general pattern.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal register, using appropriate language structures. For example:\n\n- Changing \"do you\" to \"shall I\" (in the first example) suggests a more polite request.\n- \"Help\" to \"assistance\" and \"understood\" from \"got what you said\" indicate replacing common phrases with more formal terms.\n- The third example shows replacing informal \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\".\n- The fifth example adds the relative pronoun \"whom\" to complete the clause correctly.\n\nAdditionally, in the fourth example, the sentence structure changes: \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you\". This could be restructuring the sentence for better flow or correctness.\n\nSo combining all these, the instruction might be: \"Convert the given statement into a more formal or polite version, possibly by adjusting verb forms, replacing informal phrases with more formal alternatives, restructuring sentences for clarity or correctness, and adding necessary relative pronouns or other grammatical elements to improve formality.\"\n\nAlternatively, considering all examples, the instruction could be something like \"Rewrite each sentence using more formal language, replacing contractions and informal expressions with their longer counterparts, adjusting verb tenses or forms as necessary, and ensuring proper grammar (such as adding relative pronouns when required).\"\n\nTo confirm, let's test this instruction against all examples:\n\n1. Input: Question starting with \"Do you...\". Output uses \"Shall I...\", which is more formal and a polite suggestion. This fits the instruction of using formal language and adjusting verb forms.\n2. Input: Gratitude expressed as \"Thanks...\", output expands it to \"Your assistance...\", which is more formal and uses a different structure. This aligns with replacing informal phrases and restructuring.\n3. Input: \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\", which is a more formal way of expressing inability. Fits adjusting verb forms and replacing informal with formal.\n4. Input: \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\". This could be rephrasing for clarity, avoiding the contraction and restructuring the sentence.\n5. Input: \"I met yesterday\" without a relative pronoun → output adds \"whom\" to make it grammatically correct, enhancing formality.\n\nAll examples seem to follow the instruction of formalizing language, adjusting sentence structures, replacing informal expressions, and ensuring grammatical correctness by adding necessary parts like relative pronouns.\n\nTherefore, the likely instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal version, incorporating appropriate adjustments in verb forms, sentence structure, and grammar where necessary.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version**, adjusting for grammar, verb forms, and expression style. Key aspects include:\n1. Converting informal greetings/thanks (e.g., \"Thanks for your help\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated\") into formal or expanded versions.\n2. Replacing contractions/shortened phrases with longer, formal alternatives (e.g., \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\").\n3. Restructuring sentences for clarity or correctness (e.g., \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\").\n4. Adding relative pronouns like \"whom\" to ensure grammatical completeness and formality (e.g., \"I met yesterday\" → \"whom I met yesterday\").\n\nThis systematic transformation ensures the outputs are refined, polite, and linguistically accurate.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

Hmm, first, I need to analyze each pair to see what transformation or rule was applied.\n\nStarting with the first example:\nInput: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\"\nOutput: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n\nLooking at this, the output is replacing \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish.\" So maybe the instruction is to rephrase common phrases into more formal or academic language. But let's check other examples to confirm.\n\nSecond input-output:\nInput: \"Please call once you get there.\"\nOutput: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n\nAgain, replacing \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival.\" That seems consistent with the same pattern—substituting informal phrasing with more formal equivalents.\n\nThird example:\nInput: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nOutput: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\nWait, here the output changes \"I met\" to \"whom I met.\" So that's replacing the possessive \"my\" with a relative pronoun \"whom.\" Maybe the instruction is to convert reflexive pronouns or possessives into relative clauses or formal pronouns?\n\nFourth input-output:\nInput: \"See you tonight.\"\nOutput: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n\nThis transforms a casual greeting into a more polite expectation. The output uses \"look forward to,\" which is a more formal expression of anticipation. So perhaps the instruction is to replace informal expressions with their more polite or standard counterparts.\n\nFifth input-output:\nInput: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\"\nOutput: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n\nHere, the original is a negative statement about not acting, and the output turns it into a suggestion using \"It is suggested...\" which is a formal way to propose an action. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase negative statements into positive suggestions or formal recommendations.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction likely involves rephrasing the input in a more formal, academic, or polite manner. Each output example takes a casual or informal sentence and transforms it into a more formal or polite version. Let me check again each pair to ensure consistency.\n\nFirst input's output replaces the colloquial phrase with a more formal synonym. Second example uses \"upon your arrival\" instead of the informal \"once you get there.\" Third example changes \"I met\" to \"whom I met,\" but wait, the original has \"I met yesterday,\" and the output is \"whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Wait, the possessive \"I\" becomes \"whom.\" So replacing \"I met\" (reflexive) with \"whom I met\"? Or maybe replacing the possessive \"I's\" with a relative clause? Like changing \"met yesterday\" to \"whom I met yesterday.\" So \"I\" is replaced by \"whom,\" making it a relative clause. That could be part of formalizing the structure by using relative pronouns instead of possessives.\n\nFourth example converts \"See you\" into a more formal \"look forward to meeting you,\" which is a common polite response. Fifth example turns a negative statement into a positive suggestion phrased formally as a recommendation.\n\nSo the instruction might be: \"Convert the given informal statement into a more formal or polite version.\" Or perhaps \"Rewrite the input using more standard or recommended phrasing.\"\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, the first four examples follow similar patterns: replacing certain phrases with their more formal equivalents. The fifth example is a bit different but also follows the trend of suggesting an action rather than stating a negative opinion.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the transformation types:\n\n1. Changing \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\"\n2. \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\"\n3. \"I met\" → \"whom I met\" (changing possessive to relative pronoun)\n4. \"See you\" → \"look forward to meeting you\"\n5. \"don't think it's a good idea\" → \"suggested that no action should be taken\"\n\nSo possible rules include:\n\n- Replace colloquial expressions with more formal alternatives.\n- Use relative clauses (e.g., \"whom\") instead of possessives.\n- Reframe negative statements into positive recommendations.\n- Convert informal greetings into polite expressions of anticipation.\n\nBut how to combine these into a single instruction?\n\nPerhaps the instruction is: \"Rewrite the input into a more formal or polite version, using appropriate alternatives for common phrases, ensuring clarity and politeness.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to transform each input into a more formal statement by replacing informal expressions with their standard equivalents, adjusting pronoun usage, and phrasing suggestions positively where applicable.\n\nTo verify, let's see if all outputs fit this instruction:\n\nFirst input: informal \"can't tell the difference\" → formal synonym. Check.\n\nSecond: \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\". Formal alternative. Check.\n\nThird: \"I met\" → \"whom I met\". Changes possessive to relative pronoun. This is a way to make it more formal. In some contexts, using \"whom\" is considered more formal or grammatically correct than the reflexive \"I\".\n\nFourth: \"See you\" → \"look forward to meeting you\". Polite and formal. Check.\n\nFifth: Negative statement → positive suggestion phrased formally. Check.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is likely to rephrase the input into a more formal, polite, or standard English version, adjusting common expressions and structures accordingly.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided was to **rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or standard English version** by:\n\n1. **Replacing informal expressions** with their more academic or formal equivalents (e.g., \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\").\n2. **Adjusting pronoun usage** (e.g., changing possessives like \"I\" to relative pronouns like \"whom\" for grammatical or formal correctness).\n3. **Reframing negative statements** into positive, formal suggestions (e.g., \"We don’t think...\" → \"It is suggested...\").\n4. **Polishing greetings** into polite, anticipatory phrasing (e.g., \"See you...\" → \"look forward to meeting you\").\n\n### Final Answer\nThe instruction was:  \n\"Rewrite the input into a more formal, polite, or standard English version by replacing informal expressions with appropriate alternatives, adjusting pronouns for clarity, and phrasing suggestions positively where needed.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs.\nHere are the input-output pairs:\n\nInput: Please call once you get there.\nOutput: Please call upon your arrival.\n\nInput: The whole story was made up.\nOutput: The entire story was fabricated.\n\nInput: This song is fire.\nOutput: This song is incredibly good.\n\nInput: I can't stand his temper.\nOutput: I cannot tolerate his temper.\n\nInput: I considered many approaches.\nOutput: Various approaches were considered.\n\nThe instruction was<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<|begin_of_thought|>Okay, let's try to figure out the original instruction based on these input-output pairs. Hmm. So each input has been transformed into an output, and we need to find the pattern or rule that connects them. Let me start by listing all the given examples to see if I can spot any common transformations.\n\nFirst pair:\nInput: Please call once you get there.\nOutput: Please call upon your arrival.\n\nWhat's changed here? \"once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival\". Oh, \"arrival\" is a noun, and \"there\" was replaced with \"your arrival\". Wait, maybe the idea is to turn an adverbial phrase into a more formal noun-based expression? Like, \"once you arrive\" versus \"upon your arrival\".\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: The whole story was made up.\nOutput: The entire story was fabricated.\n\nHere, \"whole\" became \"entire\", and \"made up\" became \"fabricated\". Both seem like synonyms or rephrasing in a more formal way. \"Fabricated\" is a stronger term than \"made up\", perhaps?\n\nThird pair:\nInput: This song is fire.\nOutput: This song is incredibly good.\n\nOh, here the exclamation (implied) of \"fire\" is converted into a more descriptive adjective. Fire is slang for something really good, so replacing it with \"incredibly good\" makes sense as a more polite or standard expression.\n\nFourth pair:\nInput: I can't stand his temper.\nOutput: I cannot tolerate his temper.\n\nThe structure here changes from \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\". Both are negative expressions of disliking something, but \"tolerate\" might be a more formal way of saying it compared to \"can't stand\".\n\nFifth pair:\nInput: I considered many approaches.\nOutput: Various approaches were considered.\n\nOriginal uses \"considered many approaches\", output uses \"various approaches were considered\". So \"many\" becomes \"various\", and the structure shifts from past participle to passive voice? Wait, no—the original is active voice: \"I considered (them)\", and output is \"Various approaches were considered\"—so passive voice. Also, \"many\" to \"various\" is a possible synonym.\n\nLooking for patterns across all examples:\n\n1. Some transformation of adverbs or phrases into nouns/gerunds with more formal language.\n2. Replacing colloquial or slang terms with more standard or descriptive alternatives.\n3. Adjusting sentence structure—like changing active to passive, altering modifiers.\n4. Using more formal or precise vocabulary (e.g., \"entire\" vs. \"whole\", \"fabricated\" vs. \"made up\").\n\nLet me check each example again with these possibilities in mind.\n\nFirst example: Changing the time clause \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival\". \"Arrival\" is a noun, and \"there\" becomes possessive + noun. So replacing adverbial phrase with noun phrase, making it more formal.\n\nSecond example: \"whole\" → \"entire\", \"made up\" → \"fabricated\". Both are synonyms, but \"fabricated\" is more precise and formal. So replacing informal expressions with their more accurate and formal counterparts.\n\nThird example: Slang \"fire\" → descriptive \"incredibly good\". So replacing slang/casual expressions with more positive and standard phrasing.\n\nFourth example: \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\". Both are negative expressions, but \"tolerate\" is more formal. Also, structure change from active to passive? No, \"can't stand his temper\" vs \"I cannot tolerate his temper\"—same subject. Wait, both are in present tense, first person. So maybe just changing \"stand\" to \"tolerate\" as a synonym, maintaining similar structure.\n\nWait, the input is \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output is \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" So the verb is changed from \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\". Both are negative present tenses. So the difference is between \"stand\" and \"tolerate\" as verbs. Maybe \"tolerate\" is used in a more formal context when referring to enduring someone's behavior, whereas \"stand\" is more general.\n\nFifth example: \"considered many approaches\" → \"Various approaches were considered\". Here, \"many\" becomes \"various\", which are synonyms. Also, the original uses past tense active (\"I considered\"), output uses passive voice (\"were considered\"). Wait, but the structure of the sentence is similar except for the passive voice. Let me parse both:\n\nInput: I considered many approaches. (Active)\nOutput: Various approaches were considered. (Passive)\n\nSo the main verb changes from \"considered\" (active) to \"were considered\" (passive). Also, \"many\" → \"various\". So two changes here.\n\nPutting this all together, the possible instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal, precise, and/or standard version. Let's check if these transformations fit into such a broad instruction.\n\nBut wait, some examples are more about changing the structure (passive vs. active), others about replacing words with synonyms (whole → entire, made up → fabricated), some about phrasing (once you get there → upon your arrival), some about replacing slang/colloquialisms (fire → incredibly good), and some about changing negative expressions (can't stand → cannot tolerate).\n\nIs there a unifying principle here? The user wants a general instruction that encompasses all these cases. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal and precise version, using more appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction is to convert the input into a more polite or professional version, avoiding slang and colloquialisms, using more formal language, adjusting sentence structures where necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rewrite each sentence in a way that uses more elevated diction and more complete phrases. For instance, turning \"once you get there\" into a more formal noun-based phrase, replacing informal terms with their precise equivalents, etc.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they often use longer, more complex sentences. For example, \"Please call upon your arrival\" vs \"Please call once you get there.\" The input is a simple adverbial clause, output is a more formal noun-based clause. Similarly, \"The entire story was fabricated\" vs \"The whole story was made up.\" So replacing informal \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\"\n\nThe third example: \"fire\" becomes \"incredibly good.\" So slang to descriptive.\n\nFourth example: \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate.\" So changing a less formal verb to a more formal one, and keeping the same structure.\n\nFifth example: \"Many approaches\" to \"various,\" and changing active to passive. But the structure remains the same except for the voice.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to transform the input into a more formal, polite, or standard version by using more precise vocabulary, avoiding colloquialisms, adjusting sentence structures (like passive voice, noun-based phrasing), and replacing certain words with their more accurate or formal counterparts.\n\nPutting all this together, the instruction might be something like: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal and precise version, using appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures to enhance clarity and politeness.\"\n\nBut let's test this against the examples. Take the first input: \"Please call once you get there.\" Rewriting it formally would indeed replace the adverbial clause with a noun phrase. So the instruction includes adjusting the structure from an adverbial clause to a noun-based expression.\n\nSecond input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Here, replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\" (more formal) and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\" (more precise and strong). So the instruction involves replacing certain adjectives and phrases with their more formal or exact counterparts.\n\nThird input: Changing slang \"fire\" to \"incredibly good.\" So the instruction includes replacing informal terms with more descriptive or standard ones.\n\nFourth input: Changing \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate.\" Both are negative, but \"tolerate\" is more formal, so the instruction would involve choosing synonyms that fit the formality level.\n\nFifth input: Changing \"considered many approaches\" to \"various approaches were considered.\" Here, \"many\" becomes \"various\" (synonym) and active voice to passive (structure change). So the instruction may require adjusting modifiers and voice when appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the overall instruction seems to be: \"Rearrange each input into a more formal and precise version by replacing informal phrases with more standard or descriptive alternatives, adjusting sentence structure where necessary (e.g., passive voice, noun-based phrasing), and enhancing vocabulary with synonyms that convey the intended meaning accurately and appropriately.\"\n\nThis covers all the transformations observed in the examples. Let's verify with each input:\n\n1. Input: Please call once you get there. → Output uses \"upon your arrival\" (noun phrase) instead of the adverbial clause. Formal structure.\n2. Input: The whole story → Output: entire (formal adj), made up → fabricated (formal verb).\n3. Input: This song is fire → Output: incredibly good (descriptive instead of slang).\n4. Input: I can't stand → Output: cannot tolerate (more formal verb).\n5. Input: I considered many approaches → Output: various approaches were considered (passive voice, synonym \"various\").\n\nYes, this fits. Therefore, the instruction likely required rewriting each input into a more formal, precise, and standard version, possibly involving structural changes, vocabulary upgrades, and avoidance of colloquialisms.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction given was to **rephrase each input into a more formal and precise version**, enhancing clarity and politeness through several key transformations:\n\n1. **Replace informal phrases with standard or descriptive alternatives**:  \n   - \"Once you get there\" → \"Upon your arrival\"  \n   - \"Made up\" → \"Fabricated\"  \n   - \"Fire\" → \"Incredibly good\"\n\n2. **Adjust sentence structure**:  \n   - Active voice to passive voice: \"I considered many approaches\" → \"Various approaches were considered\"  \n   - Replace adverbial clauses with noun phrases: \"Once you get there\" → \"Upon your arrival\"\n\n3. **Use more formal vocabulary**:  \n   - \"Can't stand\" → \"Cannot tolerate\"  \n   - \"Whole\" → \"Entire\"  \n\n**Final Instruction**:  \n\"Rewrite each input into a more formal, precise, and polite version by replacing informal language with descriptive alternatives, adjusting sentence structures (e.g., passive voice, noun-based phrasing), and selecting appropriate synonyms for clarity.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

Hmm. The user provided five input-output examples where their friend transformed each input into a specific output. My job is to reverse-engineer the rule or transformation that connects them. Let's start by analyzing each pair carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"Please call once you get there.\" Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\" So the output seems to replace \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\". That phrase \"once you get there\" might be rephrased using \"upon your arrival\" as a more formal or elegant version. Maybe the instruction was to replace certain phrases with their more formal equivalents?\n\nSecond pair: Input \"The whole story was made up.\" Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Here, \"whole\" becomes \"entire\" and \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated\". Both seem like synonyms but perhaps more formal terms. Maybe replacing common phrases with their more formal counterparts?\n\nThird input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" The verb here changed from \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\". So perhaps changing verbs expressing inability to accept something (like \"can't stand\") into their synonyms that mean the same but with different phrasing. \"Can't stand\" and \"can't tolerate\" are similar in meaning here.\n\nFourth input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" This one is more complex. The original statement is a negative opinion (\"don't think it's a good idea\") and ends with \"right now\". The output is a more formal suggestion phrased as \"It is suggested that...\" followed by \"no action should be taken at this stage\". So maybe converting negative opinions into positive recommendations, or rephrasing general suggestions into formal statements.\n\nFifth input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" The original is concise, but the output expands it to \"understood you\". So maybe expanding contractions or short phrases into full words.\n\nNow, putting these all together, each input-output pair shows some kind of transformation. Let's see if there's a pattern across all of them.\n\n1. Replacing informal expressions with more formal ones.\n2. Using more elevated vocabulary.\n3. Changing certain verb phrases (can't stand → can't tolerate).\n4. Converting negative opinions into suggestions or recommendations.\n5. Expanding contractions or abbreviating expressions.\n\nWait, but looking at the first three examples, the transformations seem to involve replacing parts of speech. For example, \"once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival\" (prepositional phrase). \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate\" (verb phrase). \"whole story\" becomes \"entire story\" (adjective). But the fourth example is a whole sentence structure change. The fifth example is expanding a contraction.\n\nSo maybe the overall instruction is to transform each input into a more formal, written English version, possibly making the language more elegant or adhering to certain style guidelines. Alternatively, it could be about rephrasing certain collocations into their more formal or alternative expressions.\n\nBut why would each input require such different transformations? Let me check again.\n\nFirst input: changing \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival\". Both phrases mean the same thing but the latter is more formal.\n\nSecond input: replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\". These are synonyms but more formal terms.\n\nThird input: replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\". Same meaning but different phrasing.\n\nFourth input: turning a negative opinion into a positive suggestion. \"Don't think it's a good idea\" becomes \"Suggested that no action...\", which is a recommendation rather than an opinion.\n\nFifth input: expanding \"I got what you said.\" to \"I understood you.\"\n\nSo each example involves a different type of transformation, but they all seem to fit under the umbrella of rephrasing or rewriting in a more formal or stylistically adjusted way. However, why would the fourth example be so drastically different? Because the original statement is a general opinion, whereas the output is a specific recommendation. Maybe the instruction was to convert opinions into actionable suggestions.\n\nBut the other examples don't fit that exactly. The third example is just changing a verb phrase. The first two examples are noun phrases and prepositional phrases being replaced with more formal equivalents. The fifth example is expanding a contraction.\n\nThis suggests that the instruction might be to convert informal, conversational language into more formal, written English, possibly following certain style guides or adjusting for politeness/formality. Alternatively, it could be part of a translation process, but all examples seem to stay in the same language.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they sometimes use \"your\" instead of \"his\" (as in the third example), but that doesn't seem to be a consistent pattern. Or \"suggested that\" in the fourth output, which introduces subjunctive mood. \n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to replace certain colloquialisms with their more formal equivalents. For example, replacing \"got\" with \"understood\", \"can't stand\" with \"can't tolerate\", \"made up\" with \"fabricated\", etc. But the fourth example seems to be more than that—it's changing the entire structure from an opinion to a recommendation.\n\nWait, the fourth input is: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" The output is \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" Here, the original statement expresses doubt about doing anything immediately, while the output is a neutral suggestion that no action is needed. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase negative opinions into positive, neutral recommendations. But how does that apply to the first three examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the inputs into a specific format, like converting statements into reported speech or certain sentence structures. For instance, the fourth example uses \"It is suggested that...\" which is a common construction for polite recommendations.\n\nBut the first three examples don't fit that structure. The first two are just phrasal replacements, third is a verb change. Fifth example is expanding \"I got...\" to \"I understood you.\"\n\nHmm. Another possibility: the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or academic tone, replacing contractions, colloquial phrases, and informal expressions with their more precise, elegant alternatives. The fourth example is a prime example of rephrasing a negative opinion into a neutral suggestion. The fifth example is expanding \"I got...\" to \"I understood you.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the inputs into another language, but the outputs are in the same language. Wait, no, the outputs are in English, same as inputs. So probably not translation.\n\nLet me think of possible instructions that could result in these outputs. The key here is looking for a common thread between all the transformations. Let's list each transformation:\n\n1. Replace \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\".\n2. Replace \"whole\" with \"entire\", \"made up\" with \"fabricated\".\n3. Replace \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\".\n4. Convert a negative opinion into a positive, neutral recommendation.\n5. Expand \"I got what you said.\" into \"I understood you\".\n\nLooking at these, perhaps the instruction was to make the text more formal, possibly by using longer, more complex sentences or avoiding contractions. Alternatively, it could be about rephrasing specific collocations into their more formal or synonym-based versions. For example, replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\" suggests that the instruction was to find synonyms for certain phrases, but only in specific cases.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to adjust the tone from informal to formal, which explains the fourth example's drastic change. The fourth example changes \"don't think\" into \"is suggested\", which is a more polite way of making a recommendation. This could be part of a larger instruction set where the goal is to rewrite advice or suggestions in a more professional tone.\n\nAnother angle: checking the outputs for any grammatical differences. For example, the fourth output uses \"should be taken\" (passive voice) whereas the input uses \"to do anything\" (active). Not sure if that's relevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a question or a command, but none of the outputs are questions or commands. The first output is a request, second a statement, third a statement, fourth a suggestion, fifth a statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a different part of speech. For example, the first input is a request, output is a request phrased differently. The third input is a sentence expressing inability, output is another sentence expressing inability but with different wording.\n\nWait, let's look for any possible common elements. For example, in the first four examples, the outputs are structured in a way that's more formal. The fourth example is particularly formal. The fifth example replaces \"got\" with \"understood\".\n\nAnother thought: the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a specific format, such as converting each input into an imperative sentence, but the outputs don't all fit that. The first output is an imperative, the second and third are statements, fourth is a suggestion (not imperative), fifth is a statement.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more polite or formal version. For instance, \"Please call once you get there.\" is already polite, but maybe the friend was asked to make it more formal. Similarly, \"The entire story was fabricated\" vs. \"The whole story was made up\"—maybe using \"entire\" and \"fabricated\" is more formal.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction was to replace certain words with their antonyms or synonyms. For example, \"can't stand\" to \"tolerate\" (since \"can't tolerate\" is a synonym for \"can't stand\"), but that's speculative.\n\nWait, the third input/output pair: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" So \"can't stand\" becomes \"can't tolerate\". Are \"stand\" and \"tolerate\" synonyms here? They can be in some contexts, but not always. However, in this case, they seem to be used interchangeably. So maybe the instruction was to replace certain verbs with their synonyms to make the language more precise or to adhere to certain style rules.\n\nLooking at all these possibilities, perhaps the most consistent pattern is that the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal, precise version of the original sentence. This includes replacing informal expressions, contractions, and using more elevated vocabulary where applicable. The fourth example, where an opinion is turned into a suggestion, might be a more specific case of this broader instruction. \n\nFor example, the original statement \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" is a negative opinion, which the output turns into a neutral suggestion. This could fit into the broader category of making the language more objective or turning subjective opinions into actionable recommendations, which is a form of formality or politeness.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to write the output in a way that is more concise but still maintains the original meaning, like expanding \"I got...\" to \"I understood you\". This might be part of adjusting for clarity, perhaps when translating from another language or ensuring understanding.\n\nGiven that all the outputs seem to aim for a higher degree of formality, precision, or elegance in phrasing compared to the inputs, the most likely instruction is that the friend was supposed to rephrase each input into a more formal, written English version, replacing informal expressions, contractions, and using more precise vocabulary where appropriate. The fourth example's structural change might be a subset of this—transforming opinions into recommendations—to maintain politeness and neutrality in formal contexts.\n\nTherefore, the original instruction was likely something along the lines of: \"Convert each input into a more formal, written English version by replacing informal expressions, contractions, and colloquialisms with their more precise, elevated counterparts.\" This would explain all the transformations observed in the input-output pairs.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction given to the friend was to rephrase each input into a **more formal, written English version**, transforming informal expressions, contractions, and colloquialisms into their more precise, elevated counterparts. This involved replacing phrases with synonyms, restructuring sentences for clarity and politeness, and using more sophisticated vocabulary. Below is the breakdown of how each input was rephrased according to this instruction:\n\n1. **Input:** Please call once you get there.  \n   **Output:** Please call upon your arrival.  \n   *Rephrased using a more formal prepositional phrase.*\n\n2. **Input:** The whole story was made up.  \n   **Output:** The entire story was fabricated.  \n   *Replaced \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\" for formal precision.*\n\n3. **Input:** I can't stand his temper.  \n   **Output:** I cannot tolerate his temper.  \n   *Substituted \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\" for elevated phrasing.*\n\n4. **Input:** We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.  \n   **Output:** It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.  \n   *Rephrased an opinion into a neutral, actionable recommendation to maintain formality.*\n\n5. **Input:** I got what you said.  \n   **Output:** I understood you.  \n   *Expanded the contraction \"got\" into its full form \"understood\" for clarity.*\n\n**Final Instruction:**  \nConvert each input into a more formal, precise written English version by replacing informal phrases, contractions, and colloquialisms with their elevated equivalents and restructuring sentences for clarity and politeness.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The friend provided outputs for given inputs, and I need to reverse-engineer the instruction from those examples. \n\nFirst, looking at the five input-output pairs, each input is transformed into an output with a certain pattern. Let's go through each pair step by step.\n\nStarting with the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\nHmm. The original input is a direct expression of gratitude. The output rephrases it in a slightly more formal or polite way. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase gratitude into more formal language?\n\nLet's check the second pair:\nInput: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\nOriginal is a question asking for capability. The output uses \"be able to\" and changes \"do\" to \"accomplish,\" but the structure is similar. Maybe the instruction is to convert questions into more polite phrasing? Or perhaps rephrase the entire sentence structure to make it less direct?\n\nThird pair:\nInput: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\nOriginal is a statement expressing difficulty. The output uses \"find it hard\" instead of \"can't,\" and changes \"tell the difference\" to \"distinguish.\" So replacing \"can't\" with \"find it hard,\" and adjusting some phrasings. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase negations into softer terms?\n\nFourth input:\nInput: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\nThis seems like a major structural change. The original is a negative opinion about not doing anything. The output is a more positive suggestion phrased as a recommendation. The output doesn't even use the same subject (\"it is suggested\") versus original's \"we don't think.\" So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase negative statements into positive suggestions or recommendations?\n\nFifth pair:\nInput: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\nSimilar structure here. The output replaces \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate.\" So maybe the instruction is to replace specific idiomatic expressions with their synonyms or more formal equivalents?\n\nPutting all these together: Each input is a common phrase or statement, and the output is a rephrased version that could be more polite, formal, or structured differently. But there's variation across the pairs. For example, the third pair uses \"find it hard\" instead of \"can't,\" while the fourth completely changes the structure. The fifth just replaces a phrase.\n\nWait, perhaps the instruction is to convert casual expressions into more formal or professional phrasing? But how does that fit with the fourth example where the entire sentence structure changes? Maybe the key is that each output is a more indirect or formal version of the input. Let's check the fourth example again: the original is a first-person negative, and the output is a third-person positive suggestion. That's a big shift. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase any statement into a suggestion or advice, especially when the original expresses reluctance?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to turn any request or question into a polite request or equivalent phrasing. But the first example is a statement, not a request. Hmm.\n\nWait, the first input is a statement of thanks, which the output converts to a slightly more formal response. The second input is a question asking ability, output becomes a more formal question using \"be able to\". The third is a statement of difficulty, output uses \"find it hard\". Fourth is a negative opinion converted into a positive suggestion. Fifth is replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\".\n\nLooking for a unifying theme: Each output seems to be a more indirect or euphemistic version of the input. For example, instead of directly stating \"We don't think...\" they suggest that \"no action should be taken\". Instead of \"can't stand\", \"cannot tolerate\". So maybe the instruction is to rephrase statements into more indirect or polite language, possibly avoiding strong negative words and using softer alternatives, or converting negatives into positives via suggestions.\n\nAnother angle: The outputs often use passive voice or more formal structures. For example, \"Your assistance...is much appreciated\" (passive), \"Would you be able to...\" (polite question), \"It is suggested...\" (formal). The fifth example uses \"cannot tolerate\" which is more formal than \"can't stand\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal register, using more formal synonyms, restructuring sentences, etc.\n\nWait, but the fourth example seems like a significant structural change. The original is a first-person statement, the output is a third-person suggestion. That might indicate that the instruction was to rephrase any statement into a neutral or positive recommendation. But why would \"don't think it's a good idea\" become \"suggested that no action be taken\"? That feels like taking a negative opinion and turning it into a positive action suggestion. Maybe the original instruction was to rephrase any statement into a form of advice or recommendation, especially when the original expresses hesitation or negativity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase any input into a more formal or professional version, possibly adjusting verb tenses or sentence structures. For instance, changing present tense to past or present perfect, using more formal verbs, etc. Let's see:\n\nOriginal 3rd input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" Here, \"can't\" becomes \"find it hard,\" and \"tell the difference\" becomes \"distinguish.\" So changing \"can't\" to a present perfect \"have found it hard\" might be another option, but the output uses simple present. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace \"can't\" with \"find it hard,\" but that's not the only change. The phrasing of distinguishing is adjusted too.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more indirect question. But the first example is a statement, so that wouldn't apply. Wait, first input is a statement of thanks; the output is a response thanking back. So maybe the instruction is to take any statement and rephrase it into a formalized response? But that would require understanding the context. However, the other inputs aren't statements but questions or declarations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal version, such as transforming the input into a passive voice or using more formal language. Let's see:\n\nOriginal 2nd input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" Here, the original is a simple question, output is a bit more formal. The original \"do\" becomes \"accomplish,\" adding \"would\" and \"be able to\". The third input's output replaces \"can't\" with \"find it hard\". The fourth input's output transforms the entire sentence structure from first-person to a suggestion phrased in third person. The fifth input's output replaces \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\".\n\nSo, the output seems to vary. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or indirect version, using synonyms or different sentence structures. For example, replacing contractions with full forms, changing phrasing from active to passive, using more formal language, or rephrasing to avoid direct statements.\n\nBut why such a diverse set of transformations? Let's look at each example again:\n\n1. Gratitude → formal response.\n2. Request for capability → more formal question using \"be able to\".\n3. Statement of difficulty → soften the negation.\n4. Negative opinion → transform into a suggestion.\n5. Expressing inability → use a synonym with \"tolerate\".\n\nThe fourth example seems like a bigger jump. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase any input into a polite suggestion, regardless of the original content. For example, if the input is a negative statement, rephrase it into a positive suggestion. If it's a question, rephrase it into a formal request. If it's a statement, rephrase into a formal response. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rewrite the input into a form that implies a recommendation or advice. For example, taking \"We don't think...\" and turning it into a suggestion that \"no action should be taken.\" Similarly, \"I can't stand his temper\" becomes \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" So the instruction could be to rephrase any input into a form that sounds like advice or a recommendation, possibly using \"It is suggested that\" for certain cases, and replacing strong negative phrases with milder ones.\n\nAnother possibility: the instruction was to rephrase each input into a question, but looking at the examples, the first input was already a statement, output was a response, not a question. So that's not it.\n\nWait, let's consider that the instruction might have been to convert each input into a more formal or indirect version. For example:\n\n- Replace contractions with full forms.\n- Change \"I can't\" to \"I find it difficult.\"\n- Use more formal vocabulary (e.g., \"tolerate\" instead of \"stand\").\n- Restructure sentences for clarity.\n\nLooking at the first input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" This is a complete rephrasing into a more formal statement of thanks. The output is a response to the input, not necessarily a transformation of the input itself. Hmm, but the instruction was given to the friend, so maybe the instruction was to respond to each input with a formalized version, but that seems unlikely because the fifth input is a statement about tolerating someone's temper, and the output is also a statement. But the first output is a response, not a transformed input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into its mirror image. But that seems too vague. Alternatively, the instruction could have been to rephrase the input into a form that avoids direct statements. For example, the fourth input's output uses \"It is suggested...\" instead of \"We don't think...\" which frames the advice neutrally.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to translate the input into a more positive form. For example, the first input's output is positive, the fourth's is a positive suggestion.\n\nWait, looking at all the outputs:\n\n1. Input: thanks → output: response thanking\n2. Input: request for ability → output: formal request for ability\n3. Input: difficulty → output: expressing difficulty\n4. Input: negative opinion → output: positive suggestion\n5. Input: inability → output: expressing inability\n\nHmm, interesting. So the first four examples are inputs that could be seen as requests (thanking, asking ability, expressing difficulty), and the fourth is a negative opinion, the fifth is a statement of inability. The outputs vary: the first three are responses/acknowledgments, the fourth is a suggestion, and the fifth is another acknowledgment. \n\nWait, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formalized response, but the fourth example breaks that pattern. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more indirect or recommended action. Let's see:\n\nOriginal fourth input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" So here, instead of expressing doubt, they're suggesting inaction. So maybe the instruction was to convert any expression of hesitation or negativity into a recommendation for no action. But then why the fifth example, which is about tolerating someone's temper, is changed to \"I cannot tolerate his temper\" without suggesting action? Unless the instruction was broader: whenever the input expresses doubt, rephrase it into a recommendation. But the first three examples are not negative; they're expressing thanks, asking ability, stating a difficulty. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase any input that expresses uncertainty or negative opinion into a recommendation for a positive action. But the first three examples don't fit that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase any statement into a question. But again, the first input is a statement, output is a response, which isn't a question. So that's not it.\n\nWait, looking back at the fourth example: the input is a statement of opinion, the output is a recommendation. So maybe the instruction was to take any input and rephrase it into a recommendation or advice. But why the first example, a statement of thanks, is turned into a response. Unless the instruction was broader: process each input into a formalized version, regardless of the original's intent. For example, turn a statement of thanks into a response, a question into a formal version, a negative opinion into a recommendation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a polite version. Like, replace informal phrases with more formal ones. For example:\n\n- \"Thanks\" becomes \"Your assistance...\"\n- \"Can you...\" becomes \"Would you be able to...\"\n- \"I can't tell\" becomes \"I find it hard...\"\n- \"We don't think...\" becomes \"It is suggested...\"\n- \"I can't stand\" becomes \"I cannot tolerate...\"\n\nYes, that fits. The instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, using appropriate language depending on the context. For example, replace contractions, use more formal vocabulary, adjust sentence structure for politeness.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis against the examples:\n\n1. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Here, \"thanks\" is replaced with \"Your assistance...\", which is more formal and uses \"is appreciated\" instead of \"thanks\".\n\n2. Input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" Using \"Would you be able to\" is more polite than \"Can you\", and \"accomplish\" is more formal than \"do\".\n\n3. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" Replacing \"can't tell\" with \"find it hard\" and changing \"difference\" to \"distinguish\".\n\n4. Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" Here, the negative opinion is rephrased into a neutral/suggestive tone using \"It is suggested\".\n\n5. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\" for formality.\n\nSo each output is a more formal or polite version of the input, sometimes rephrasing entire sentence structures. The instruction likely told the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or structured version of the original statement, possibly using synonyms, changing sentence structures, and avoiding contractions or informal phrasing.\n\nTherefore, the instruction was probably something like: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal, polite version, using appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure to convey the same meaning.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal, polite version**, utilizing appropriate vocabulary, sentence structure, and tone adjustments. This involved transforming contractions, adjusting phrasing for politeness, and reorganizing sentences to maintain or enhance clarity and formality. \n\n**Key transformations observed:**\n1. **Gratitude**: Replace casual \"thanks\" with formal acknowledgment (\"Your assistance is much appreciated\").\n2. **Requests for Capability**: Use polite phrasing (\"Would you be able to accomplish...\") instead of direct questions.\n3. **Expressions of Difficulty**: Soften negations (\"can’t tell\") to softer equivalents (\"find it hard\").\n4. **Negative Opinions**: Rephrase doubts into neutral recommendations (\"It is suggested...\").\n5. **Inabilities**: Substitute informal idioms (\"can’t stand\") with formal synonyms (\"cannot tolerate\").\n\nThis systematic approach ensures outputs align with a professional or courteous register, regardless of the original input’s formality or context.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

So, the user provided five input-output pairs, and I need to deduce the general rule or transformation that was applied. Let's go through each pair step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the outputs versus the inputs. The outputs seem to be restatements or rephrasing of the original statements. But each has its own particular style. Let's break them down:\n\n1. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n   Hmm, the output uses \"my opinion\" where the original says \"I think\". Maybe the instruction was to convert first-person statements into more formal or indirect language, using phrases like \"it is my opinion\".\n\n2. Second input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n   Here, the output is more about suggesting a course of action rather than stating a negation. The original is a negative thought; the output is rephrased as a suggestion not to act. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase negative thoughts into positive suggestions or to frame advice instead of opposition?\n\n3. Third input: \"I considered many approaches.\" Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n   The output simplifies \"considered\" to \"were considered\" and adds \"various\", which makes it a bit more general. So perhaps the instruction was to make the sentence more neutral or to use more formal terminology by removing subjective words (like \"I\") and adding qualifiers.\n\n4. Fourth input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\"\n   This seems like replacing \"got what\" with \"understood\" but keeping the second person. So maybe the task was to rephrase affirmative statements into more direct or concise versions, possibly removing filler phrases.\n\n5. Fifth input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n   The output changes \"can you\" to \"would you be able to\". So here, converting questions into conditional possibilities. The output might be rephrasing requests for capability into a form that implies permission or possibility.\n\nNow, putting these together, each output seems to be a variation of taking the original statement and restructuring it into a different phrasing while maintaining the overall meaning. Let's see if there's a common thread.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\n- The first example uses \"my opinion\" instead of \"I think\".\n- The second turns a negative opinion into a suggestion.\n- The third uses more formal terms (\"were considered\" vs. \"considered\") and adds \"various\".\n- The fourth removes \"got what\" and keeps the meaning.\n- The fifth replaces \"can you\" with \"would you be able to\".\n\nPossible instruction: \"Redetermine each statement to a more formal or professional tone, using appropriate language and restructuring as needed.\" But perhaps more specific. Let's think again.\n\nWait, the first output is a rephrasing using \"it is my opinion\". The second uses \"it is suggested\". The third uses \"were considered\". The fourth uses \"I understood you\". The fifth uses \"Would you be able to accomplish...\". \n\nAlternative approach: Maybe each output is a type of rephrasing, so the instruction could be something like \"Convert each input into the corresponding output type\". But what's the connection between the types?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to transform each statement into a specific type of response. For example, converting statements into questions, or making suggestions instead of opinions. Wait, the first input becomes an expression of opinion, the second becomes a suggestion, the third is a neutral statement, the fourth is a confirmation, and the fifth is a possibility phrased as a question.\n\nWait, but the fifth output is not a question anymore—it starts with \"Would you...\" which is a conditional question. Wait no: The original input is a question \"Can you...\", and the output is \"Would you be able to...\", which is also a question, but framed differently. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the original question into a different form, such as turning it into a more polite request or expressing doubt.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to take the original statements and turn them into more formal or indirect expressions. Let's consider possible instructions:\n\nOption 1: \"Rewrite each statement in passive voice.\"\n\nBut let's check. First input: \"I think...\" becomes \"This is interesting.\" which is passive, but the output here is \"It is my opinion...\" which isn't passive. So that doesn't fit.\n\nOption 2: \"Turn each statement into a suggestion instead of an opinion.\" But the first input is an opinion, and the output is a suggestion. The second input is a statement that's a reason not to act, and the output is a suggestion not to act. So maybe the instruction was to reframe negative opinions into constructive suggestions.\n\nOption 3: \"Rephrase each statement using more formal language and removing first-person references.\" For example, the first input loses \"I think\", the second becomes a suggestion, the third uses more formal \"were considered\", fourth uses \"understood\", fifth changes \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\" which is more formal.\n\nOption 4: \"Transform each input into a similar-sounding output by adjusting vocabulary and structure.\" Each output seems to have made adjustments to key words or added phrases. For example, \"I think\" -> \"my opinion\", \"considered\" -> \"were considered\", \"got what you said\" -> \"understood you\", etc.\n\nWait, another angle: The outputs often start with \"It is...\", \"It is suggested...\", \"Various approaches were...\", etc. So maybe the instruction was to create such statements, but how? For example, the first input becomes \"It is my opinion that...\" which matches the output. The second becomes \"It is suggested...\", the third becomes \"Various approaches were considered\", etc. So perhaps the instruction was to generate these specific types of responses: when the input is a personal opinion, output it as a formalized opinion statement; when the input is a suggestion not to act, output it as a suggestion; when the input is a consideration of approaches, output it as a passive statement; when the input is an understanding, output as a confirmation; and when the input is a question about ability, output it as a question phrased with possibility.\n\nBut how does that unify? Let's check:\n\nInput 1 is a first-person opinion → Output is third-person opinion starting with \"It is my opinion\".\n\nInput 2 is a statement of not doing anything → Output is a suggestion phrased with \"It is suggested\".\n\nInput 3 is a past consideration → Output is passive \"were considered\".\n\nInput 4 is a first-person understanding → Output is \"I understood you\".\n\nInput 5 is a question about capability → Output is a question phrased with \"Would you be able to...\".\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a specific type of statement. For example:\n\n- If the input is a personal opinion, output it as a formalized opinion.\n- If the input expresses hesitation or lack of action, rephrase it as a constructive suggestion.\n- If the input discusses approaches considered, present it neutrally as a passive statement.\n- If the input conveys understanding, confirm it concisely.\n- If the input is a capability question, rephrase it into a conditional possibility.\n\nBut this seems too fragmented. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to \"restate each input in a professional tone, replacing 'I' with appropriate phrases, and restructuring sentences as necessary.\" But without more data points, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, they often use \"It is [my opinion/suggested/etc.]\" which suggests that the instruction was to start each output with a phrase indicating the nature of the statement (e.g., \"it is my opinion\", \"it is suggested\", etc.). But why would the instruction specify that? Unless the instruction was to convert the inputs into statements formatted with certain introductions.\n\nWait, perhaps the instruction was: \"For each input, rephrase it into a similar-sounding output by adjusting vocabulary and structure, ensuring each output begins with 'It is' followed by an appropriate phrase (e.g., my opinion, suggested, etc.)\". But even then, why the varying starts?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a more formalized version, using certain stock phrases. For example:\n\n- When someone says \"I think X,\" output \"It is my opinion that X.\"\n- When someone says \"We don't think Y,\" output \"It is suggested that Y should not be done.\"\n- When someone says \"I considered Z,\" output \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n- When someone says \"I got A,\" output \"I understood A.\"\n- When someone asks \"Can you B?\" output \"Would you be able to accomplish B?\"\n\nThis would explain the pattern. Each input corresponds to a different case handled by the instruction. So the instruction might have been structured along these lines, covering different scenarios: handling opinions, suggestions, considerations, understandings, and capability questions.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the original instruction likely involved transforming each input into a specific type of response based on the content. For example, rephrasing personal opinions into formalized opinions, reframing hesitations into constructive suggestions, neutralizing approach discussions, concisely confirming understanding, and rephrasing capability queries into conditional possibilities.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **restate each input in a professional, neutral tone using specific structured responses**. The outputs were generated by converting the inputs into standardized phrasings tailored to their content:\n\n1. **Personal Opinions**: Transform \"I think\" statements into formalized opinions.  \n   - Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\"  \n   - Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"  \n\n2. **Negative Hesitations**: Reframe reluctance into constructive suggestions.  \n   - Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea...\"  \n   - Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken...\"  \n\n3. **Approach Considerations**: Neutralize discussions about methods into passive observations.  \n   - Input: \"I considered many approaches.\"  \n   - Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"  \n\n4. **Confirmations**: Simplify affirmative statements into concise confirmations.  \n   - Input: \"I got what you said.\"  \n   - Output: \"I understood you.\"  \n\n5. **Capability Queries**: Reorient questions about ability into conditional politeness.  \n   - Input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\"  \n   - Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"  \n\n**Final Instruction:**  \nFor each input, apply the following guidelines:  \n- Replace \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion\".  \n- Convert hesitations into suggestions phrased with \"it is suggested\".  \n- Restate approach reviews neutrally as \"various approaches were considered\".  \n- Confirm understanding directly.  \n- Rephrase capability questions into polite conditional requests.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

All these input-output pairs have some kind of transformation or modification. Let's look at each pair closely.\n\nFirst, Input 1 is \"The whole story was made up.\" The output is \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Hmm, so replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\" and changing \"made up\" to \"fabricated\". Maybe the instruction was to replace certain adjectives or phrases with synonyms. But not all the outputs here seem like synonyms. For example, \"entire\" is a synonym for \"whole,\" but \"fabricated\" is a synonym for \"made up\" in the sense of being false. So maybe the general rule is replacing adjectives or modifying parts of speech when possible. But let's check other examples.\n\nSecond input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, the friend added \"whom\" instead of \"I\". So replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" when referring to oneself. That might be a case of formalizing language or replacing pronouns with their objective cases where appropriate. But only in some cases? Wait, maybe it's when the pronoun is the subject? Let's see. In the output, \"whom\" is the subject after \"was\". Original had \"I\" (subject). So maybe whenever the pronoun is the subject, replace with \"who\", and when it's the object, leave as \"me\"? Wait, no. Because the original input uses \"I met\", which is past tense. In the output, it's \"whom I met\". So the subject is \"the lawyer\", and \"whom\" is the object. Wait, the structure here is \"The lawyer [whom/ I] met yesterday...\". So in the original, it's \"I met\", which is first person. In the output, it's \"whom I met\", but \"whom\" is the object. So maybe the instruction is to convert first-person pronouns to third-person, but here, since the input was first-person, the output is third-person with \"whom\"? Or perhaps the friend was instructed to replace \"I\" with \"who\" in the subject position. Wait, the original input has \"I met\", where \"I\" is the subject. The output changes \"I\" to \"whom\", making \"whom met\", but then \"met\" is the verb. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, in the input, \"I met yesterday\" becomes \"whom I met yesterday\". So the \"I\" is replaced with \"whom\", and the structure is \"The lawyer [whom] I met...\" So maybe the instruction is to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" when it's the subject. But that would change the grammar, because \"whom\" is an object pronoun. So maybe the rule here is to convert the subject \"I\" into \"who\" when the clause is used as a relative clause. Hmm, maybe that's a case of converting the sentence structure from direct statement to a relative clause. For example, \"The lawyer I met yesterday\" becomes \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday\". So replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" in that context. But why would that happen? Maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentence into a relative clause structure, which sometimes requires using \"whom\".\n\nThird input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\" So here, changing the entire sentence structure from a question (\"Do you want me...\") to a suggestion or formal request (\"Shall I...\"). The output seems like a more formal version, possibly in the subjunctive mood. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase yes/no questions into polite suggestions or commands. Alternatively, perhaps it's transforming \"do you want X\" into \"shall I X\" as a more formal or polite way. Let's check if there's a pattern here. The original question is a second-person query about wanting the speaker to go along. The output is a second-person suggestion using \"shall I\" which is a bit formal. So maybe the rule is to turn yes/no questions into \"shall I\" type suggestions. But why does \"Do you think...\" become \"It is suggested that...\" for Input 4?\n\nFourth input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" So here, the entire sentence is transformed into a suggestion using \"it is suggested that\". The original statement expresses doubt and proposes no action. The output uses a more formal phrasing, turning the negative opinion into a suggestion. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase statements that express reluctance or disapproval into formal suggestions or recommendations. For example, changing \"don't think\" into \"suggest that no...\" So perhaps whenever there's a statement expressing hesitation or negative view, convert it into a suggestion using \"it is suggested that\".\n\nFifth input: \"This song is fire.\" Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\" Here, a slang term \"fire\" is replaced with a more formal synonym. Maybe the instruction was to replace informal expressions with more formal or standard phrasing. Like converting colloquialisms to more neutral or elevated language.\n\nNow, putting all these together, each input-output pair seems to involve different transformations. The first two might relate to pronoun usage or part-of-speech substitution, the third involves changing question structure to suggestion, the fourth involves rephrasing opinions into suggestions, and the fifth is replacing informal language with formal synonyms.\n\nWait, but the fifth example could also fit into the same category as the first, where \"fire\" is a slang term for \"good\", so replacing informal adjectives. But the first example was a noun phrase (\"whole story\") vs (\"entire story\"). So maybe the instruction is to replace certain adjectives or noun phrases with their more formal counterparts. But why the others?\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be a set of rules that apply in different contexts. Let's list possible patterns:\n\n1. Replace \"whole\" with \"entire\".\n2. Replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in certain clauses.\n3. Convert yes/no questions into polite suggestions starting with \"Shall I\".\n4. Rephrase negative opinions into formal suggestions like \"it is suggested that\".\n5. Replace informal slang with formal equivalents.\n\nBut this seems like a mix of different rules. Alternatively, maybe there's a common thread. Let's see:\n\nLooking at all outputs, they are more formal or polite than the inputs. For example, \"fabricated\" is a more formal synonym for \"made up\". \"whom\" is used in a more formal context. \"Shall I...\" is more formal than \"Do you want me...\". \"It is suggested that...\" is a more formal way of expressing an opinion. \"Incredibly good\" is a more formal alternative to \"fire\". \n\nSo perhaps the overall instruction was to make the language more formal or polite. Let's check each input-output pair against this hypothesis.\n\nInput 1: \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Both are formal, but \"entire\" is a synonym, and \"fabricated\" is a more formal alternative to \"made up\". This fits.\n\nInput 2: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Changing \"I\" to \"whom\" makes it more formal, as using \"whom\" here is correct in a relative clause structure.\n\nInput 3: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\" The output is more formal and polite compared to the casual question.\n\nInput 4: \"We don't think it's a good idea...\" → \"It is suggested that...\" This transforms the negative opinion into a more formal suggestion.\n\nInput 5: \"This song is fire.\" → \"This song is incredibly good.\" Replacing the slang with a more formal equivalent.\n\nAll of these outputs are more formal or polite versions of the inputs. So perhaps the instruction was to rewrite the input sentences using more formal or polite language, possibly following specific transformations. \n\nBut wait, how do these transformations differ? Let's see:\n\n- Input 1: Adjective replacement (whole→entire), verb (made up→fabricated)\n- Input 2: Pronoun replacement (I→whom) in a relative clause\n- Input 3: Question→suggestion (Do you...→Shall I...)\n- Input 4: Negative opinion→suggestion (don't think→is suggested that...)\n- Input 5: Colloquialism→formal adjective\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is a combination of these transformations, but the common thread is formality and politeness. However, maybe there's a single overarching instruction that encompasses all these changes. Let's think: If the task is to rephrase the given sentences into a more formal style, which of these transformations would typically be part of such a process?\n\nFormalizing language often includes:\n\n- Using passive voice where appropriate\n- Avoiding contractions and colloquial terms\n- Using more precise synonyms\n- Changing pronouns to their objective forms in certain contexts\n- Rewriting questions as indirect requests\n- Presenting suggestions rather than opinions\n\nLooking at the examples, Input 2 uses \"whom\" which is more formal. Input 3 turns a direct question into a suggestion starting with \"Shall I...\", which is a common way to rephrase \"Do you want me...\". Input 4 replaces a negative opinion with \"it is suggested that...\", which is a more formal way to present advice. Input 5 replaces informal slang with a more formal synonym.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to convert the input sentences into more formal and polite versions, possibly including several specific transformations like those observed. But the key is whether there's a unified instruction that covers all these cases. For instance, the first transformation is replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\". These are both examples of replacing words with their more formal counterparts. Similarly, the second example uses \"whom\" instead of \"I\" in a relative clause. The third example converts a yes/no question into a polite suggestion. The fourth example turns a negative opinion into a formal suggestion. The fifth example replaces slang with a more formal term.\n\nIf the instruction was to rewrite the input sentences into a more formal register, considering various stylistic adjustments, then all the outputs align with that. However, the question is to find the original instruction. Since the user hasn't specified the exact instruction, but the friend applied five different transformations, it's likely that the instruction was a combination of different rules aimed at making the language more formal and polite. But to deduce the exact instruction, we need to see if there's a common element across all the transformations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each sentence according to a specific template or transformation. For example, each input-output pair might correspond to a different transformation rule. However, the user provided five examples, each requiring a different change. That makes it difficult unless there's a overarching theme.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they all seem to follow a certain pattern. Let's list them again:\n\n1. Whole → Entire; made up → fabricated (adjective replacement, more formal)\n2. I → whom (pronoun case change)\n3. Do you want... → Shall I... (question → suggestion)\n4. Don't think → Suggested that no action (opinion → recommendation)\n5. Fire → Incredibly good (slang → formal adjective)\n\nEach of these could be part of a larger instruction. For example, the instruction might be to:\n- Convert certain adjectives or noun phrases to their more formal equivalents (rule 1)\n- Use objective case pronouns (\"whom\") in relative clauses (rule 2)\n- Turn yes/no questions into polite suggestions (rule 3)\n- Reframe negative opinions as formal recommendations (rule 4)\n- Replace informal slang with more formal language (rule 5)\n\nBut how to combine these into a single instruction? Perhaps the instruction was a set of rules for making language more formal and polite, which could include these specific transformations. Alternatively, the instruction could be a more general one like \"polish the language by making it more formal,\" and the friend applied several possible polishing techniques.\n\nBut the problem states that the instruction was a single thing, not multiple rules. So perhaps the original instruction was a specific transformation or set of transformations. However, given that the user expects the assistant to reverse-engineer the instruction based on the output examples, we need to identify what unifying principle underlies all these transformations.\n\nLooking back at the outputs, they all end up being more formal. For example:\n\n- Input 1 becomes more precise and formal.\n- Input 2 uses a more formal pronoun.\n- Input 3 becomes a polite suggestion.\n- Input 4 is presented as a suggestion rather than an opinion.\n- Input 5 uses a more formal synonym.\n\nSo the underlying instruction might be to rephrase the input into a more formal register. However, in natural language processing, formalization can involve many aspects, but the key is to find a common thread among all the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to use a particular translation or substitution for each input. But without knowing the original instruction, it's challenging. Another approach is to look for a common part-of-speech tag or grammatical structure that was changed across all examples.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\n1. The entire [ADJ] ... fabricated [VERB]\n2. The lawyer [NOUN] whom [PRON]...\n3. Shall [VERB] I [PRON]...\n4. It is suggested [VERB phrase] that ...\n5. This song is [ADJ] incredibly [ADJ] good.\n\nIn each case, there's a change in part of speech or word choice that contributes to the formalization. But how to connect these?\n\nAlternatively, consider that each output is a transformation of the input where certain elements are upgraded or changed to sound more sophisticated. For example:\n\n- \"whole\" to \"entire\": specificity increase.\n- \"made up\" to \"fabricated\": more formal.\n- \"I met\" to \"whom I met\": formal pronoun.\n- \"Do you want...\" to \"Shall I...\": polite phrasing.\n- \"don't think\" to \"is suggested\": formal phrasing.\n- \"fire\" to \"incredibly good\": replacing slang with formal.\n\nSo the instruction might be to enhance the formality and sophistication of the language, possibly through multiple steps like adjective substitution, pronoun case adjustment, question-to-suggestion conversion, opinion-to-suggestion, and slang replacement.\n\nBut to formulate this as an instruction, it could be something like:\n\n\"Rewrite the sentence to make it more formal and polite, possibly by replacing informal terms, adjusting pronouns to their objective cases in certain clauses, converting questions into polite suggestions, reframing negative opinions as formal recommendations, and substituting less formal adjectives with more precise alternatives.\"\n\nHowever, the original instruction might have been shorter and more specific. But given the available information, the most accurate answer is that the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version, possibly applying several transformations like those observed in the examples. Therefore, the instruction likely involved formalizing the language by making changes such as those demonstrated in the output pairs.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe original instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version**, applying specific linguistic transformations to enhance precision, formality, and social politeness. This involved:\n\n1. **Replacing informal adjectives/noun phrases** (e.g., \"whole → entire\", \"made up → fabricated\") for greater specificity.\n2. **Adjusting pronoun cases** (e.g., \"I → whom\" in relative clauses to maintain grammatical consistency with formal style).\n3. **Converting questions into polite suggestions** (e.g., \"Do you want... → Shall I...\").\n4. **Reframing opinions as formal recommendations** (e.g., \"don't think → is suggested that\").\n5. **Substituting slang with formal equivalents** (e.g., \"fire → incredibly good\").\n\nThese transformations collectively aimed to produce more formal, sophisticated language suitable for contexts like academic writing or polite conversation.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs where each input was transformed into a specific output. My task is to deduce what the original instruction could have been based on these examples.\n\nFirst, I'll start by listing out each input and its corresponding output again to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nInput 1: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\nSo here, the original sentence uses \"I think that...\" and the output replaces it with \"It is my opinion that...\". That might be changing the perspective from first person to third person objective. Let me note that.\n\nInput 2: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\nAgain, replacing \"I can't\" with \"I find it hard\", and changing the phrasing slightly. So maybe the instruction involves rephrasing expressions of inability or uncertainty into more formal terms.\n\nInput 3: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\nOriginal is a question using \"can\", output changes it to \"be able to\" and adjusts the verb structure. So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase questions using \"can\" into more polite or formal versions, maybe using \"be able to\" and adjusting the sentence structure.\n\nInput 4: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\nOriginal is informal (\"once you get there\"), output makes it more formal by using \"upon your arrival\". So maybe the instruction is to replace casual time phrases with more formal ones.\n\nInput 5: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\nOriginal is an informal expression of greeting/anticipation, output turns it into a more formal statement expressing anticipation. So the instruction might involve converting casual expressions into more polite or professional ones.\n\nLooking at all these outputs, they seem to be more formal, polite, or elevated in tone compared to the inputs. For example, changing \"I think that...\" to a more objective-sounding phrase, replacing contractions (\"can't tell\") with full phrases, restructuring questions with \"can\" into more formal phrasing, and replacing informal greetings with more formal expressions of looking forward.\n\nNow, what common elements do these transformations have? Let's break down each input-output pair to see possible patterns.\n\nFor Input 1-2: The transformation seems to involve making the statement more objective (removing \"I\" and using \"it is my opinion\"), but also adjusting the structure to use \"that\" which might be part of a larger clause. However, not all outputs use \"that\"; the third input's output doesn't have \"that\". Wait, Input 3's output is \"Would you be able to...\", which is a different structure. So maybe the instruction is not uniform across all inputs.\n\nWait, let's check each transformation step by step.\n\nInput 1:\nOriginal: I think that this is interesting.\nOutput: It is my opinion that this is interesting.\nHere, \"I think\" becomes \"It is my opinion\". The \"that\" remains. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the speaker's opinion into a more formal version.\n\nInput 2:\nOriginal: I can't tell the difference between these two.\nOutput: I find it hard to distinguish between them.\nHere, \"I can't tell\" becomes \"I find it hard to\", and the object is adjusted from \"the difference between these two\" to \"distinguish between them\".\n\nInput 3:\nOriginal: Can you do all these tasks?\nOutput: Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\nThe original is a question, changed to \"Would you be able...\", so changing \"can\" to \"be able to\". Also, the original \"do\" is replaced with \"accomplish\", which is a synonym but perhaps more formal.\n\nInput 4:\nOriginal: Please call once you get there.\nOutput: Please call upon your arrival.\n\"Once you get there\" is replaced with \"upon your arrival\". The structure changes from a conditional (\"once\") to a prepositional phrase (\"upon\").\n\nInput 5:\nOriginal: See you tonight.\nOutput: I look forward to meeting you tonight.\nThis is a significant change. The original is an informal way of saying \"I'll see you later\" or \"I'll meet you tonight\". The output is a formal statement expressing anticipation. So maybe the instruction involves converting casual expressions of meeting into more polite or formal statements.\n\nNow, considering all these transformations, perhaps the original instruction was to \"polite formality\". But that's vague. Let's think deeper.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they often use more formal language, avoid contractions, and adjust the structure to sound more polite. For example, replacing \"can\" with \"be able to\", changing \"I think\" to a more objective phrasing, using \"upon\" instead of \"once\", and turning informal greetings into more formal expressions.\n\nAdditionally, in some cases, the tense is preserved but the structure is adjusted. For example, \"can\" becomes \"be able to\" (imperative mood?), but in Input 4, the tense doesn't seem to change; \"call once\" becomes \"call upon your arrival\" which is similar in tense (future). Wait, no: \"once you get there\" implies future action when arriving, while \"upon your arrival\" also refers to the future moment. So the tense isn't really changing, just the phrasing.\n\nIn Input 1, the output uses \"is my opinion\", which is a present tense statement, same as the original. So maybe the instruction didn't require changing tenses, just the phrasing.\n\nAnother thought: the outputs might be using more elevated vocabulary. For example, \"distinguish\" instead of \"tell the difference\", \"look forward to\" instead of \"see you\".\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have required converting direct speech or informal expressions into a more formal or professional tone, possibly in a written context like business communication.\n\nLet me check the inputs and outputs again for possible commonalities:\n\n1. Formal vs. informal tone: Inputs use contractions, first-person singular, colloquial expressions. Outputs use more formal language, third-person perspective, less contractions, more complete verb structures.\n\n2. Rephrasing questions: Input 3 uses \"Can you...\", output rephrases to \"Would you be able to...\", which is a different structure.\n\n3. Changing time expressions: Input 4 has \"once you get there\", output uses \"upon your arrival\".\n\n4. Expressing meeting: Input 5 uses \"See you tonight\", output uses \"I look forward to meeting you\".\n\nSo the instruction likely involves rewriting the input sentences to make them more polite and formal, possibly in a business or professional setting. This includes avoiding contractions, rephrasing questions and time expressions, and transforming casual greetings into more formal anticipatory statements.\n\nTo confirm, let's hypothesize the instruction: \"Rewrite the following sentences to make them more formal and polite, adjusting the structure where necessary.\"\n\nTesting this hypothesis against the examples:\n\n1. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output uses \"It is my opinion...\", which is a more formal phrasing of a personal opinion. So changing from first-person subjective to third-person objective.\n\n2. \"I can't tell the difference...\" → Output changes \"can't tell\" to \"find it hard to distinguish\", which is a more polite way of expressing difficulty.\n\n3. \"Can you...\" → Output changes to \"Would you be able to...\", which is a more polite form of request for capability.\n\n4. \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output uses \"upon your arrival\", which is a more formal way of referring to the moment of arrival.\n\n5. \"See you tonight.\" → Output becomes a formal anticipation of meeting, \"I look forward to meeting you\".\n\nYes, all these fit under the category of making the language more formal and polite. Therefore, the instruction was likely asking to rewrite the input sentences in a more formal and polite manner, possibly in a professional or formal context.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction given was likely to **polish and formalize** the input sentences, transforming them into more **professional or polite phrasing**. Here’s the breakdown based on the analysis:\n\n1. **Tone and Structure Adjustments**: \n   - Replace contractions (e.g., \"I can't\" → \"I find it hard\").\n   - Shift perspective from first-person (\"I think\") to third-person (\"It is my opinion\").\n   - Restructure questions (e.g., \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\").\n\n2. **Formal Time Expressions**:\n   - Replace casual \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\".\n\n3. **Polite Anticipation**:\n   - Convert informal greetings (\"See you tonight\") into formal expressions like \"I look forward to meeting you\".\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nThe instruction was to **rephrase the sentences into a more formal and polite tone**, suitable for professional or courteous communication.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

So the user provided five input-output pairs, each showing a transformation from an input sentence to an output. My job is to determine what general rule or instruction the friend used to generate those outputs based on the given examples.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to get a clearer picture.\n\n1. Input: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\n   Hmm, so replacing \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\". But why those specific words? Maybe \"fire\" here is being used metaphorically to mean \"exciting\" or \"great\". The output uses a synonym that conveys the same meaning but more explicitly. So perhaps the instruction is to substitute certain phrases with more descriptive alternatives.\n\n2. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n   Here, the input has a pronoun \"I\" which might be redundant in a relative clause. The output removes \"I\" from \"whom I met yesterday\", making it \"whom I met yesterday\" becomes \"whom met yesterday\"? Wait, no. Let's check the original input: \"I met yesterday\" becomes \"met yesterday\". Wait, but the output's phrase is \"whom I met yesterday\". Wait, maybe the input has \"I\" after \"whom\", so the original structure is \"whom I met\", but when it's rewritten, they removed \"I\" before \"whom\". So the original is \"whom [subject] met\", but the output removes \"I\" so it's just \"whom met\". Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait the input is \"whom I met yesterday\". So the output is \"whom met yesterday\". But that changes \"I met\" to \"met\", removing the subject. That would change the meaning. But the output's sentence still makes sense because the subject is implied. Wait, but the original sentence is \"The lawyer [whom I met yesterday] was helpful.\" So \"I met the lawyer yesterday\" — the output is \"The lawyer whom met yesterday was helpful.\" Which would imply \"the lawyer who met yesterday\" — but that's not the same as \"I met the lawyer yesterday\". Wait, maybe there's confusion here. Let me parse this again.\n\nOriginal Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The subject here is \"the lawyer\", the relative clause is \"I met yesterday\". So the relative clause refers back to the lawyer. So in the output, the friend changed \"I met yesterday\" to \"met yesterday\", removing \"I\". But the original meaning is that the speaker met the lawyer, but in the output, the relative clause is \"whom met yesterday\". Wait, the output says \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the structure is \"whom\" + \"I met yesterday\". So the \"I\" is still present. Wait, no. The input had \"whom I met yesterday\", and the output is \"whom met yesterday\". So the \"I\" is removed. But that changes the meaning. Because the relative clause in the input was \"whom [I] met yesterday\", meaning the lawyer that the speaker met yesterday. In the output, it's \"whom met yesterday\", which would imply the lawyer who met the speaker yesterday. But that's a different meaning. However, the output's sentence still makes sense because \"whom met yesterday\" could refer back to the lawyer (the one being referred). So maybe the instruction was to remove unnecessary words, like \"I\" in certain contexts where the subject is clear.\n\n3. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n   The input is a question about wanting to go with someone. The output is a more formal rephrasing using \"shall I\" instead of \"do you want me\". Also, the verb changes from \"want to go\" to \"accompany you\". So maybe the instruction is to rephrase questions into polite requests, often by changing the interrogative form to a more formal command.\n\n4. Input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n   Again, a similar transformation. The input is a yes/no question asking ability, and the output rephrases it into \"would you be able to...\" using past ability (\"be able to\"). So perhaps the instruction is to replace \"can you\" with \"would you be able to\", and adjust the sentence structure accordingly.\n\n5. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n   The original is a negative statement about not noticing a difference. The output uses \"find it hard to\" and replaces \"tell the difference\" with \"distinguish between them\". So maybe the instruction is to rephrase negated statements into more neutral or positive phrasing, using synonyms or different structures.\n\nNow, looking at all these transformations, there's a pattern of replacing certain phrases or structures with more formal or alternative phrasings. Let's categorize the possible instruction types:\n\n- Replacing colloquial expressions with more formal or precise terms.\n- Converting questions into polite requests or more formal phrasing.\n- Adjusting sentence structure, such as removing pronouns or restructuring clauses.\n- Converting negative statements into less direct expressions.\n- Using synonyms or different collocations.\n\nLooking at the first example, \"fire\" replaced with \"incredibly good\". The word \"fire\" here is a metaphor for something being great. So maybe the instruction is to replace common colloquial phrases with more explicit or descriptive synonyms. But why only \"fire\"? That's the only case where a word was replaced; others involved restructuring sentences.\n\nIn the second example, the input had \"I met yesterday\" and the output removes \"I\", making it \"met yesterday\". But in the original sentence, \"I met the lawyer yesterday\" implies that the lawyer met the speaker. But the output's \"whom met yesterday\" could refer to the lawyer (the subject) if \"whom\" is the object of a preposition. Wait, let's parse that again. Original input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, \"I met yesterday\" is the relative clause modifying \"lawyer\". So \"the lawyer [that I met yesterday] was helpful.\" The output becomes \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the relative clause is \"whom I met yesterday\". So \"whom\" is the subject of the relative clause. But usually, in relative clauses, we don't use \"whom\" unless it's the object of a preposition. Wait, maybe the original was intended to have \"whom\" in the relative clause, implying the speaker was the one met by the lawyer. Wait, but in standard grammar, the relative clause \"I met yesterday\" would be \"the lawyer whom I met yesterday\" — \"whom\" is the object of \"met\". But the output is \"whom I met yesterday\", which would mean the subject is \"whom\" and the predicate is \"I met yesterday\". That seems odd. So perhaps the friend made a mistake here, but since the output is considered correct, maybe the instruction allowed for some restructuring. Alternatively, maybe the original input had a pronoun \"me\" missing, and the output added it. Wait, original input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the relative clause is \"I met yesterday\". But in standard English, that would require \"I\" to be the subject of the verb \"met\", but \"I\" is the object here. Wait, no. Let me check the grammar. The relative clause \"who/whom I met yesterday\" would be correct if \"met\" is transitive. So \"the lawyer whom I met yesterday\" — \"whom\" is the object of \"met\". But the input is \"I met yesterday\" — that's not a complete clause. So maybe the input was supposed to be \"I met the lawyer yesterday\" — then the relative clause is \"whom I met\". But the way the input is written is unclear. Perhaps the friend misanalyzed the structure and thought that \"I met yesterday\" needs to be moved into the relative clause, leading to \"whom I met yesterday\". So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase certain clauses by moving elements into the relative clause structure. Alternatively, the friend might have been instructed to use \"whom\" in the relative clause when possible, even if the original didn't have it.\n\nMoving on to the third example, changing \"Do you want me...\" to \"Shall I...\". This is a common politeness strategy. \"Shall I\" is a more formal or traditional way to offer to help, whereas \"do you want me...\" is a direct question. So the instruction might be to rephrase questions into offers or requests using \"shall I\".\n\nFourth example: Changing \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\". This shifts the focus from possibility (\"can\") to ability (\"be able to\"), and the use of \"would\" adds a conditional tone. So the instruction could involve adjusting the modal verbs or restructuring the question to sound more like a request.\n\nFifth example: Changing \"I can't tell the difference...\" to \"I find it hard to distinguish...\". This replaces a negative expression (\"can't tell\") with a more neutral phrasing (\"find it hard to\"). So perhaps the instruction is to avoid negative constructions and use alternative phrasing.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction likely involves transforming the input sentences into more formal or polite versions, often by replacing colloquial expressions with their more formal counterparts, restructuring clauses, or rephrasing questions and negatives into more appropriate forms.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, many of them start with \"Would you be able to...\", \"Shall I...\", etc., which are more formal ways of asking for help or making suggestions. Similarly, the first output uses a synonym for \"fire\" which is \"incredibly good\", suggesting replacement of informal expressions with descriptive adjectives. The second example involves removing \"I\" in a relative clause, which might be part of making the sentence flow better or follow stricter grammar rules. The third example's transformation from \"Do you...\" to \"Shall I...\" is a common politeness strategy. The fourth example shifts \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\", adding more formality and ability phrasing. The fifth example replaces a negative (\"can't tell\") with a more neutral expression involving \"find it hard\".\n\nSo compiling all these patterns, the instruction probably tells the friend to rewrite each input into a more formal or polite version, often by:\n\n1. Changing questions into polite requests (e.g., \"Do you...\" → \"Shall I...\" or \"Would you be able to...\").\n2. Replacing informal expressions with more descriptive or formal synonyms (like \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\").\n3. Restructuring clauses, particularly relative clauses, to improve clarity or adhere to grammatical conventions (like removing \"I\" from the relative clause).\n4. Avoiding negatives by rephrasing to more positive or neutral expressions.\n\nAdditionally, some examples might involve adjusting pronoun usage or verb tenses. For instance, the first example changes \"is fire\" to \"is incredibly good\", but that's a lexical substitution. The second example is a clause restructuring. The third is a question-to-command rephrasing, the fourth a modal change, and the fifth a negative to neutral rephrase.\n\nConsidering all these points, the most probable instruction is that the friend was asked to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, often by converting questions into offers, using synonyms for informal expressions, rephrasing negatives into neutral statements, and restructuring clauses for clarity or correctness. The exact wording might be something like \"Rewrite each sentence into a more formal or polite version, using appropriate phrasing and avoiding slang or colloquialisms.\" Or perhaps more specific instructions like \"Replace informal questions with more polite requests\" or \"Use more formal synonyms where applicable.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to use certain structures: for example, changing \"Do you...\" to \"Shall I...\" in offers, replacing \"Can you...\" with \"Would you be able to...\", using \"incredibly good\" for \"fire\", etc. But the key is that the instruction required applying a set of transformation rules to make the sentences more formal or polite.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to the friend was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version**, often by applying specific transformations such as:\n\n1. **Converting questions into offers or polite requests**:\n   - Example: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\"  \n     (\"Do you...\" → \"Shall I...\").\n\n2. **Replacing informal or colloquial expressions with more formal synonyms**:\n   - Example: \"This song is fire.\" → \"This song is incredibly good.\"  \n     (\"fire\" → \"incredibly good\" for emphasis).\n\n3. **Structuring clauses for clarity or adherence to grammar rules**:\n   - Example: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"  \n     (\"I met\" → \"whom I met\" to avoid redundancy).\n\n4. **Rephrasing negatives to neutral or positive statements**:\n   - Example: \"I can't tell the difference...\" → \"I find it hard...\"  \n     (\"can't tell\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\").\n\n5. **Adjusting verb phrases for politeness or formality**:\n   - Example: \"Can you do...\" → \"Would you be able to...\"  \n     (\"can\" → \"be able to\" + \"would\" for politeness).\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nThe instruction was to rephrase each input sentence into a more formal or polite version, often by converting questions into offers, replacing colloquialisms with synonyms, restructuring clauses, and adjusting negations or verb phrases for politeness.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs, so I need to analyze each pair to see if there's a common transformation or rule that applies to all of them. Let's start by looking at each example one by one.\n\nFirst example: Input is \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" Output is \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" Hmm. So here, the original statement is expressing a negative opinion on doing something now. The output rephrases this as a suggestion not to take action. Maybe the instruction was to turn negative statements into suggestions using \"it is suggested that...\"?\n\nLet me check the other examples to see if this pattern holds. Second input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\" That seems like replacing \"want\" with \"shall I [verb]\". The first person question becomes a second person suggestion. That fits. Third input: \"Thanks for your help.\" Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Here, the output is more formal and uses \"is much appreciated\" instead of direct thanks. So maybe converting thanks into more polite expressions.\n\nFourth input: \"I considered many approaches.\" Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\" This changes \"considered\" to past tense? Wait, the input is present perfect: \"I have considered\", but output is past tense \"were considered\". Wait, maybe the original is \"I considered\" (past) but in the input it's written as \"I considered\"? Wait, looking again: the input says \"I considered many approaches.\" So the output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" The verb form changed from \"considered\" to \"were considered\" (passive voice). So perhaps the instruction is to convert active voice to passive voice?\n\nFifth input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" The output uses \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up.\" So maybe replacing common phrases with their synonyms. For example, \"was made up\" becomes \"was fabricated.\"\n\nSo compiling these observations: The instruction could involve multiple transformations. But wait, the first example seems to be changing a negative statement into a suggestion. The second example is converting first person questions into second person suggestions. The third is turning thanks into polite expressions. The fourth is converting active to passive voice. The fifth replaces a phrase with a synonym.\n\nBut the problem states that the instruction was given once, so probably all outputs are derived from a single rule. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to translate into a different style or register. Let me re-examine each pair.\n\nFirst input-output: The original is a negative statement about not doing anything. The output is a suggestion not to act. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase negative opinions into neutral or positive suggestions. For example, instead of \"We don't think it's a good idea,\" say \"It's suggested that no action should be taken.\"\n\nSecond input: A first-person question (\"Do you want me...\") becomes a second-person suggestion (\"Shall I...\"). So changing the perspective from asking permission to offering to do something.\n\nThird input: Direct thanks become a more formal expression. Like replacing \"thanks\" with \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n\nFourth input: Active voice \"I considered\" becomes passive \"were considered.\" So changing from active to passive voice.\n\nFifth input: \"was made up\" → \"was fabricated.\" Replacing collocation with a synonym.\n\nHmm. So possible instructions could include multiple aspects: converting negatives to suggestions, changing perspective from first to second person, converting gratitude to polite expressions, changing voice from active to passive, replacing collocations with synonyms.\n\nBut the problem states that the instruction was a single instruction. So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the inputs into more formal or polite language. Let me check each example against that idea.\n\nFirst input: Negative statement → more formal/suggestive. Output does that. Second: casual question → polite offer. Third: direct thank → formal appreciation. Fourth: active voice → passive. Fifth: common phrase → synonym. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version, possibly including suggestions where applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to use different phrasing structures. For instance, changing questions into offers, negatives into suggestions, etc. But how to unify all these?\n\nWait, another angle: looking at the outputs, they seem to be more formal or professional versions of the inputs. The first example uses \"suggested\" instead of the original negative. The second turns a question into a suggestion. The third changes \"Thanks\" to \"Your assistance is...\" which is more formal. The fourth converts active to passive. The fifth uses a synonym. So perhaps the overall instruction is to rewrite the input in a more polite, formal, or professional tone, sometimes making suggestions when appropriate.\n\nBut is that a single instruction? It could be. Alternatively, the instruction might involve multiple steps, but since the user says \"the instruction was,\" implying a single rule. So maybe each output is a result of applying a specific transformation based on the input's context.\n\nWait, let's look for a common thread. All outputs are slightly rephrased. The first input's output is a suggestion phrased formally. The second is a rephrased question into a suggestion. The third is transforming a direct thank into a more formal expression. The fourth changes active voice to passive. The fifth replaces \"was made up\" with \"was fabricated.\"\n\nLooking at the verbs: The first example changes the negative opinion into a suggestion. The second changes the question into a suggestion. The third turns \"Thanks\" into a noun phrase. The fourth uses passive voice. The fifth replaces a verb phrase with a synonym.\n\nHmm. Perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more polite or formal version, which might involve converting negatives into suggestions, questions into offers, direct thanks into formal expressions, active voice to passive, and replacing common phrases with synonyms. But that seems like multiple rules. However, the user says \"the instruction was,\" so perhaps there's a single underlying principle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a different style, such as converting imperative statements into polite requests, but the examples don't fit that. Or maybe the instruction was to use different vocabulary or sentence structures, like synonyms or different tenses.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see what each output does compared to the input.\n\n1. Input: Negative opinion → Output: Suggestion in formal style.\n2. Input: Question → Output: Offer in suggestion form.\n3. Input: Gratitude → Output: Formal expression of thanks.\n4. Input: Past tense (active) → Output: Passive voice.\n5. Input: Common phrase → Output: Synonym.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to transform the input into a suggestion or offer when possible, use more formal language, change voice, replace collocations. But again, how to unify this into a single instruction?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to translate the input into a more formal or professional version, sometimes rephrasing as a suggestion or offer. But the exact wording would depend on what the original instruction said.\n\nWait, perhaps the instruction was \"Rewrite the input into a more polite and formal version, using suggestions where appropriate.\" That could cover all the examples. Let's check:\n\n- First example: The original negative is turned into a polite suggestion.\n- Second example: The question becomes a polite offer (\"shall I accompany\").\n- Third: Direct thank becomes formal appreciation.\n- Fourth: Active voice (first person) is changed to passive to make it more formal or objective.\n- Fifth: \"made up\" is replaced with \"fabricated\" to use a more formal term.\n\nYes, that seems to fit. So the instruction might have been to rephrase the input into a more formal, polite, or professional style, using suggestions or offers when appropriate. But is there a way to describe this concisely?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to use different phrasing structures, like changing the question into a suggestion, negatives into suggestions, gratitude into formal expressions, etc. But without seeing the exact instruction, we have to deduce based on the outputs.\n\nGiven the examples, the most plausible instruction is that the friend was supposed to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, often turning statements or questions into suggestions or offers. The key would be to identify the common thread among all outputs. For instance, the outputs often replace the original verbs or phrases with more formal or suggested alternatives.\n\nAnother thought: looking at the first example's output, it starts with \"It is suggested that...\" which is a common way to present advice or recommendations. The second example uses \"Shall I...\", which is a polite way to ask for permission or offer to do something. The third uses \"Your assistance is much appreciated,\" which is a more formal way of thanking someone. The fourth example converts \"I considered\" to \"Various approaches were considered,\" which could be a more objective or passive rephrasing. The fifth replaces \"was made up\" with \"was fabricated,\" suggesting a synonym substitution.\n\nIf the instruction was to rephrase the input into a formal or professional style, sometimes using suggestions or offers, then all these examples align. The key would be to look for the most consistent transformation across all inputs. For example, the use of \"It is suggested that...\" in the first output might indicate that the instruction involved suggesting actions based on the original statement. But the second example doesn't use that structure. Alternatively, the instruction could be to translate questions into offers, which the second example does, but others don't.\n\nWait, perhaps the instruction was to translate the input into a question form, but the outputs don't all do that. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to turn negative statements into positive suggestions, which the first example does, and maybe others. The third example transforms gratitude into a suggestion-like expression. The fourth example uses passive voice, which can imply objectivity. The fifth uses a synonym.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to rephrase each input using different parts of speech or sentence patterns. For example, using \"suggested\" or \"should\" where appropriate. The first example adds \"suggested that\" and a subjunctive \"should be taken.\" The second example uses \"shall I,\" which is a different structure. The third uses \"is much appreciated,\" a noun phrase. The fourth uses passive voice. The fifth uses a synonym.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Another approach: look for what's missing in the outputs. For example, the first output starts with \"It is suggested that,\" which might indicate that the instruction involves structuring responses in that way. The second example's output uses \"Shall I,\" which is a way to ask permission or offer to do something. The third example is a rephrased thank you note. The fourth uses passive voice, which might be to remove the subject (\"I\"). The fifth uses a synonym.\n\nPerhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a different type of sentence. For example, if the input is a negative statement, output a suggestion; if it's a question, output an offer; if it's a thank you, output a formal expression; if it's active, output passive; if it's a common phrase, replace with synonym. But this would require conditional logic based on the input type, which isn't indicated by the user.\n\nSince the user states that the instruction was given once, likely a single rule or guideline applied uniformly. Considering all outputs, the most consistent element is the use of formal language. For example, the first example's output is more formal than the input. The second example's output is a more polite version of the question. The third example turns a direct thanks into a more formal expression. The fourth uses passive voice (which is more formal), and the fifth uses a synonym which might be considered more formal or precise.\n\nThus, the instruction could be: \"Rephrase the input into a more formal and polite version of the original statement, using appropriate linguistic structures such as suggestions, offers, or formal expressions.\"\n\nAlternatively, if the instruction was specifically to convert certain phrases, like turning questions into offers, that might be the case. For example, the second example's output \"Shall I accompany you?\" is a common way to rephrase \"Do you want me to go with you?\" into a more polite offer.\n\nBut how to generalize this across all inputs? The third example transforms gratitude into a formal expression, which could be seen as part of making the message more polite. The fourth example uses passive voice to present information neutrally. The fifth example replaces \"was made up\" with \"was fabricated,\" a more technical term.\n\nIn conclusion, the most comprehensive instruction that covers all outputs would be to rephrase the input into a more formal and polite version, possibly including turning questions into offers, negatives into suggestions, gratitude into formal expressions, active voice to passive, and replacing common phrases with synonyms. However, since the instruction must be concise and unified, the best answer would be that the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal and polite version, using suggestions or offers where appropriate. Therefore, the instruction likely stated something along the lines of: \"Rephrase the input into a more formal and polite version, using appropriate suggestions or offers when applicable.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to the friend was to **rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version**, incorporating appropriate suggestions or offers where suitable. This involved transforming the original statements into more structured, professional language by:\n\n1. **Converting negative opinions into constructive suggestions** (e.g., \"We don't think...\" → \"It is suggested that...\").\n2. **Turning questions into polite offers** (e.g., \"Do you want me...\" → \"Shall I...\").\n3. **Expressing gratitude formally** (e.g., \"Thanks for your help.\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated\").\n4. **Changing active voice to passive to enhance objectivity** (e.g., \"I considered...\" → \"Various approaches were considered\").\n5. **Replacing colloquial phrases with synonyms** (e.g., \"was made up\" → \"was fabricated\").\n\nBy applying these transformations, the friend ensured the outputs were clear, polite, and adhered to a professional tone, aligning with the instruction's focus on formal rephrasing. \n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe instruction was to rephrase each input into a **more formal and polite version**, often using **suggestions** or **offers** when appropriate.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

So, the user provided five input-output pairs where each input was transformed into an output. My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction from these examples. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the patterns between each input and its corresponding output. Let's go through each pair one by one.\n\nStarting with the first input: \"See you tonight.\" The output is \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" Hmm. Comparing the two, the output seems more formal and uses \"look forward to\" instead of a direct greeting. Maybe the instruction was to make a more polite or formal response?\n\nSecond input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" Again, there's a slight change in wording. Instead of \"can't tell,\" they used \"find it hard.\" So maybe the instruction involves converting negative questions into softer expressions? Or perhaps rephrasing the sentence structure.\n\nThird input: \"She looks like her sister.\" Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" The verb here changed from \"looks like\" to \"resembles.\" Both are synonyms, but \"resembles\" might be a more formal or precise term. Maybe the instruction was to replace informal phrasing with more formal ones?\n\nFourth input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" Oh, this is a bigger shift. The original is a negation of an idea (\"don't think it's a good idea\") and the output is rephrased as a positive suggestion not to act. The structure here changes significantly. So perhaps the instruction was to convert negative recommendations into positive suggestions, using different phrasing entirely?\n\nFifth input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" Here, the verb \"got\" is replaced with \"understood,\" and the object \"what you said\" becomes \"you.\" The structure simplifies the sentence. Maybe the instruction was to make the sentence more concise or use more standard terminology?\n\nNow, considering all these transformations, what common thread connects them? Let's categorize possible instruction types:\n\n1. **Formalizing language**: Changing informal phrases to more formal ones (like replacing \"can't tell\" with \"find it hard\").\n2. **Rephrasing negations**: Turning \"We don't think...\" into a positive suggestion about not taking action.\n3. **Simplifying sentence structure**: Reducing wordiness or changing verb forms (e.g., \"looks like\" → \"resembles\").\n4. **Replacing idiomatic expressions**: Converting colloquialisms to more standard phrasing (e.g., \"got what you said\" → \"understood you\").\n\nLooking deeper, the fourth example is particularly complex. The original is a statement of a lack of an idea, and the output frames it as a recommendation not to take action. This suggests that the instruction might involve restructuring entire sentences, not just replacing individual words. Alternatively, it could be transforming negative advice into positive alternatives.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, some use modal verbs (like \"should be taken\" in the fourth example). The fourth input didn't have any modal, but the output does. That might indicate that the instruction involved adding or modifying modal verbs based on context.\n\nLet's also check for common phrases or templates. For instance, the fourth output uses \"It is suggested that no action should be taken.\" Maybe the instruction was to rephrase any statement that advises against doing something by converting it into a suggestion not to act.\n\nSimilarly, the third input's output replaces \"looks like\" with \"resembles,\" which is a more formal synonym. Maybe the instruction was to replace certain phrasal verbs with their more formal equivalents.\n\nLooking at the fifth input, \"I got what you said\" to \"I understood you.\" This is a matter of replacing \"got\" with \"understood\" and adjusting the sentence structure. Perhaps the instruction was to ensure the verb matches the subject in tense and form, or to use more standard past tense verbs.\n\nAnother observation: the outputs seem to be slightly longer than the inputs except the fifth example. The first four outputs are lengthier than their inputs, while the fifth is shorter. However, this might vary based on the transformation needed.\n\nNow, putting this all together, the instruction likely requires taking an input and rewriting it according to specific stylistic or structural rules. Let's hypothesize possible instructions:\n\n- **Option 1:** Rewrite each input into a more formal tone by replacing contractions and informal expressions with more polite language.\n- **Option 2:** Convert any statements of negation (e.g., \"don't think it's a good idea\") into positive suggestions or recommendations (like \"it is suggested that...\").\n- **Option 3:** Restructure sentences to avoid direct negations and instead frame them as recommendations not to act unless certain conditions are met.\n- **Option 4:** Replace informal verbs/phrases with their more formal counterparts, such as replacing \"look forward to\" with more appropriate forms, changing \"resemble\" from \"look like,\" etc.\n- **Option 5:** Simplify complex phrases by using more straightforward verbs or removing extraneous words.\n\nBut which of these aligns with all examples? Let's test each hypothesis.\n\nFor Example 1: \"See you tonight\" → \"I look forward to meeting you.\" This fits a more formal rewrite. \"Look forward to\" is indeed a more formal way to express anticipation. Similarly, Example 2: \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish.\" This fits the formalizing pattern.\n\nExample 3: \"She looks like her sister\" → \"resembles.\" This is part of formalizing, replacing \"looks like\" with \"resembles.\"\n\nExample 4: The big structural change. The original negates an idea, and the output rephrases it as a suggestion. This doesn't fit the immediate formalizing or simplifying, but maybe the instruction was to handle negative recommendations specifically.\n\nExample 5: \"I got what you said\" → \"understood you.\" This is replacing \"got\" with \"understood\" and adjusting the sentence. Maybe the instruction required using past tense verbs correctly or replacing certain verbs with their more appropriate forms.\n\nBut the fourth example seems to be a case where the entire structure is transformed, not just a phrase substitution. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase any statement advising against an action into a positive recommendation against taking action at that time.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the fourth input-output pair:\n\nInput: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\"\nOutput: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n\nSo the original is a negative statement about not thinking it's a good idea, and the output is a suggestion not to take action. The output is actually a positive suggestion, which the input wasn't. So maybe the instruction was to convert any advice against an action into a recommendation to hold off until a certain condition is met. But why does the output use \"at this stage\" rather than specifying a condition?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase any statement expressing reluctance to act into a more formalized version that still conveys the same message but in a way that implies a structured process or timing. Like suggesting to wait until conditions are better.\n\nBut then, how does this apply to other examples? The second example is a simple rephrasing without changing the action's validity. The third is a synonym substitution. The fourth is a structural change, and the fifth is a verb replacement.\n\nThis suggests that the instruction isn't a single rule but might have multiple cases based on the input. For instance:\n\n- If the input is a greeting, rewrite it into a more formal expression.\n- If the input expresses uncertainty (like \"can't tell\"), rephrase it as a difficulty.\n- If the input is a statement of appearance, use a synonym.\n- If the input is a negative recommendation, rephrase it as a suggestion not to act.\n- If the input is a statement of understanding, simplify it.\n\nBut how can an instruction encompass all these varied transformations? It might require handling different types of inputs with different rules. However, the user provided five examples covering different types, so the instruction likely has multiple components.\n\nAnother approach: look for a common thread in the outputs. The outputs tend to be more declarative, sometimes slightly more assertive, and often avoid negative structures. For example, the fourth input's output is a positive suggestion instead of a negation.\n\nPerhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more affirmative and formal tone, adjusting verb forms, replacing idioms, and structuring the sentence to avoid direct negations when advising against action.\n\nBut how to formulate this as an instruction? The user might have given an instruction like: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal and positive tone, avoiding contractions and negative phrasing where applicable.\"\n\nAlternatively, if the instruction was more specific, like targeting negative recommendations, it would explain how to handle those cases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate each input into a more polite version by using appropriate conjunctions and phrasing.\n\nWait, looking back at the first output: \"I look forward to meeting you.\" The original is \"See you tonight.\" So the instruction might have been to turn greetings into expressions of anticipation.\n\nThe second input-output pair is \"I can't tell...\" → \"I find it hard...\" which is a way to soften the language, replacing \"can't\" with \"find it hard.\"\n\nThird: \"She looks like her sister\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" Using a more formal synonym.\n\nFourth: Entirely rephrased to suggest inaction instead of advising against. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase any advice against action into a recommendation not to proceed now.\n\nFifth: Simplifying \"I got what you said\" into \"I understood you.\"\n\nPutting this all together, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input according to different rules based on the content. For example:\n\n- For greetings, use \"I look forward to [activity].\"\n- For statements of inability to distinguish, rephrase to \"I find it difficult to see the difference.\"\n- For similarities expressed as \"look like,\" use \"resemble.\"\n- For negative recommendations, rephrase as \"It is suggested that [action] should not be taken at this stage.\"\n- For understanding statements, simplify to \"I understood you.\"\n\nBut the user probably had a single instruction that covers all these cases. However, since the examples are diverse, it's possible that the instruction was a combination of multiple rules. But given that the user's instruction was likely a single command, perhaps the key was to rephrase the input in a more formal, positive, and polite manner, adjusting verb forms, synonyms, and sentence structures accordingly.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, the fourth example uses \"It is suggested that,\" which is a construction often used in formal writing or recommendations. Maybe the instruction was to turn any input that advises against an action into a positive suggestion phrased as a recommendation.\n\nBut how to generalize this across all examples? The fourth example is a case where the output is not just a synonym but a completely different sentence structure. The other examples are more about substituting parts of speech or rephrasing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version by making the following changes:\n\n1. Replace informal contractions (e.g., \"can't\" → \"cannot\", \"don't\" → \"do not\").\n2. Use more formal synonyms (e.g., \"resemble\" instead of \"look like\").\n3. Adjust sentence structure to avoid negatives, especially in recommendations.\n4. Use more polite phrasing (e.g., \"look forward to\" instead of \"see you\").\n5. Simplify verb forms and remove redundant words.\n\nBut the fourth example's transformation goes beyond synonyms and structure—it completely changes the meaning from advising against an idea to suggesting no action. So maybe the instruction had specific rules for certain types of inputs, such as turning negative recommendations into positive non-action suggestions.\n\nGiven the diversity of the examples, it's challenging to pinpoint a single instruction. However, the most common element across all outputs is the adjustment to make the language more formal, polite, and possibly avoid negatives. The fourth example is the only one that completely restructures the sentence, but others involve substitutions.\n\nAnother possible instruction could be: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal and positive tone, ensuring that any negative recommendations are rephrased into suggestions not to take action unless certain criteria are met.\" But this is quite specific and may not cover all examples.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to \"rephrase each input using more formal language and appropriate verb tenses, replacing colloquial terms with synonyms, and avoiding contractions.\" But this is still broad and doesn't specifically address the fourth example.\n\nGiven that the fourth input-output pair is a major structural change, perhaps the instruction was more specific to that case. However, since all examples are included, the instruction likely encompasses various transformations.\n\nIn summary, after analyzing each pair, the most plausible instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, and positive tone, adjusting verb forms, replacing colloquial expressions with synonyms or more structured alternatives, and avoiding negative phrasing in recommendations. The specific transformation rules might depend on the input type, but the overall goal was to make the output more formal and polite while accurately conveying the meaning.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, and positive tone**, adjusting verb forms, replacing colloquial expressions with synonyms or structured alternatives, and avoiding negative phrasing in recommendations. Here’s a breakdown based on the examples:\n\n1. **Greeting/Expectation**:\n   - Input: \"See you tonight.\"  \n     Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"  \n     **Rule**: Replace greetings with \"look forward to\" to express anticipation formally.\n\n2. **Softening Uncertainty**:\n   - Input: \"I can't tell the difference...\"  \n     Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish...\"  \n     **Rule**: Replace \"can't tell\" with \"find it hard\" to soften language.\n\n3. **Formal Synonyms**:\n   - Input: \"She looks like her sister.\"  \n     Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"  \n     **Rule**: Substitute \"resemble\" for \"look like\" for a formal tone.\n\n4. **Reframing Negative Recommendations**:\n   - Input: \"We don’t think it’s a good idea...\"  \n     Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"  \n     **Rule**: Rephrase negative advice as structured, positive non-action suggestions.\n\n5. **Simplifying Comprehension**:\n   - Input: \"I got what you said.\"  \n     Output: \"I understood you.\"  \n     **Rule**: Simplify \"got\" to \"understood\" and adjust sentence structure.\n\n**Final Instruction**:  \n\"Rewrite each input into a more formal and polite version, adjusting verb forms, synonyms, and sentence structure to avoid colloquialisms and negative recommendations, while maintaining the original meaning.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs where a friend followed an instruction by transforming each input into an output. The task is to figure out what the original instruction was. So I need to analyze each pair and find a common pattern or rule that applies to all of them.\n\nStarting with the first input-output pair. Input is \"Can you do all these tasks?\" and output is \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" Hmm. Comparing these two sentences. The original is a question asking if they can perform certain tasks. The output seems to rephrase it but in a slightly different way. Instead of using \"can\" directly, it uses \"would you be able to\". Also, \"do all these tasks\" becomes \"accomplish all these tasks\". Maybe the instruction is about rephrasing questions into a more formal or polite form? Let me check the next pair.\n\nSecond input-output: \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" Here, the original is a casual greeting, and the output is a more formal expression of anticipation. So maybe the instruction is to convert casual expressions into more formal ones? But wait, not all outputs are formal. For example, the third input is \"I got what you said.\" output is \"I understood you.\" That seems like paraphrasing the meaning. So perhaps the instruction is to paraphrase the input into a different but equivalent statement. Let me check another pair.\n\nThird input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" So here, the original is a colloquial expression meaning 'understood', and the output is a more direct statement. So replacing idioms or informal phrasing with their meanings. Wait, but the second pair was converting casual to formal. So maybe the instruction is to replace certain expressions with more formal equivalents? Or maybe transform the entire sentence structure.\n\nFourth input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" So here, the output is restating the same idea but starting with \"It is my opinion...\" instead of \"I think that...\". So replacing \"I think that\" with \"It is my opinion that\" perhaps. Then the fifth input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\" So here, the original is a question asking for permission or request, and the output is a more formal \"shall\" instead of \"do you want\". So combining all these examples, maybe the instruction is to convert each input into a more formal or polite version by restructuring the sentence or replacing certain phrases.\n\nBut wait, looking at the third pair again: \"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\" That's a direct paraphrase, not necessarily formal. So maybe the main pattern is to rephrase the input into a more formal tone by changing sentence structures or replacing certain verbs. Let's test this hypothesis against the pairs:\n\n1. \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\" – changing the modal verb \"can\" to \"be able to\", which is a more formal phrasing. Also, adding \"able to accomplish\" might make it more formal. Original question is about ability; output is rephrased as capability.\n\n2. \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to meeting you.\" – original is casual, output is formal greeting with anticipation.\n\n3. \"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\" – Here, the output is a paraphrase of the input's meaning, so it's a direct replacement of the idiom \"got what you said\" with the verb phrase \"understood you\". Not exactly formal, but maybe part of rephrasing.\n\n4. \"I think that...\" → \"It is my opinion...\" – Replacing \"I think\" with \"my opinion\" to make it more indirect, perhaps more formal.\n\n5. \"Do you want me to...\" → \"Shall I...\" – Changing the interrogative from \"do you want\" to \"shall I\", which is a more formal way to ask for permission or to offer assistance.\n\nSo, possible instruction could be: \"Convert each input into a more formal or polite version by adjusting sentence structure, replacing certain phrases, or rephrasing the entire sentence.\"\n\nAlternatively, another angle: looking for a common transformation. For example, some of the outputs seem to invert subject-verb order. Let's check:\n\n1. Input: \"Can you...\" → Output: \"Would you be able to...\" – no inversion. \"Can you...\" is a question, output is a different question.\n\n2. Input: \"See you...\" → Output starts with \"I look forward...\" – subject changes from \"you\" (implied) to \"I\".\n\n3. Input: \"I got what...\" → Output: \"I understood...\" – same subject.\n\n4. Input: \"I think...\" → Output: \"It is my opinion...\" – subject changes from \"I\" to \"It\".\n\n5. Input: \"Do you want...\" → Output: \"Shall I...\" – subject changes from \"you\" to \"I\".\n\nSo in some cases, the subject changes. Like input 2 to output: \"you\" becomes \"I\". Input 4: \"you\" to \"I\". Input 5: \"you\" to \"I\". Input 1 doesn't change subject. Input 3 keeps \"I\".\n\nWait, in input 3, the original is \"I got what...\", and output is \"I understood...\", so same subject.\n\nIn input 1, the subject is implied (the person being addressed), but in output, it's phrased as \"Would you be able...\" So perhaps the instruction is to start the output with \"you\" instead of addressing them with \"can you\"? Or perhaps replace \"can you\" with \"would you be able to\".\n\nAlternatively, looking for other patterns:\n\nInput 2: \"See you\" → \"I look forward to meeting you\". So replacing the greeting with a statement of anticipation.\n\nInput 4: \"I think...\" → \"It is my opinion...\". So changing \"I think\" to \"my opinion\" (indirect speech).\n\nInput 5: \"Do you want me to...\" → \"Shall I...\". So replacing \"do you want\" with \"shall I\" (asking for permission).\n\nHmm. Another approach: look for words or phrases that are consistently changed. For example, in the first pair, \"can\" becomes \"be able to\". In input 4, \"I think that\" becomes \"my opinion that\". In input 5, \"do you want\" becomes \"shall I\".\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might be to convert questions into statements in a particular way, or to rephrase in a more formal tone.\n\nLooking across all inputs and outputs:\n\n- Input 1: Question → Question, different phrasing.\n- Input 2: Greeting → Statement of intention.\n- Input 3: Idiomatic expression → Direct statement.\n- Input 4: Opinion expressed → Formal opinion.\n- Input 5: Request/offer → Formal request.\n\nMaybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal version by using different vocabulary, sentence structures, or tones.\n\nAnother angle: Check for any recurring transformations. For instance:\n\n- Changing \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\" (using \"able\" instead of \"can\").\n- Converting \"I think that...\" to \"It is my opinion that...\" (rephrasing \"I think\" to \"my opinion\").\n- Replacing \"Do you want me to...\" with \"Shall I...\" (formalizing the request).\n- Turning \"See you...\" into \"I look forward...\" (changing the perspective from \"we'll see\" to expressing eagerness).\n\nAlso, in input 3, \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you\". This seems like a direct substitution of \"got what you said\" with \"understood\". Similarly, \"do you want me to\" becomes \"shall I\".\n\nSo possible patterns include:\n\n1. Rephrasing casual or informal expressions into more formal or standard language.\n2. Converting certain phrases like \"I think that...\" into \"It is my opinion that...\".\n3. Changing requests like \"Do you want me to...\" into offers like \"Shall I...\".\n4. Replacing \"Can you...\" with \"Would you be able to...\".\n5. Turning greetings into more formal statements.\n\nPutting this together, the instruction likely tells the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version by adjusting sentence structures, replacing specific phrases, or converting the overall tone. For example, converting questions, requests, and casual expressions into more formal equivalents.\n\nAnother possible clue is that in some outputs, the subject shifts from the implied \"you\" to \"I\". For example:\n\n- Input 2: \"See you...\" (implied \"you\") → Output starts with \"I look forward to...\".\n- Input 4: \"Do you want me to...\" → Output starts with \"Shall I...\" (subject becomes \"I\").\n\nThis suggests that the instruction might involve starting the output with \"I\" when the input is in the second person (\"you\"), thus shifting the perspective.\n\nTesting this hypothesis:\n\nOriginal: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" (second person). Output: \"Would you be able to...\" Still second person. So perhaps only some inputs require shifting to \"I\".\n\nInput 2: \"See you...\" → Shift to \"I\". Input 4: Shift to \"I\". Input 5: Shift to \"I\". Input 1 and 3 don't shift. Hmm, inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to always use \"I\" when possible. But input 3 remains \"I\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the entire sentence into a more formal version, possibly changing the subject if necessary.\n\nGiven all this, the most likely instruction is something along the lines of: \"Convert each input into a more formal or polite version by rephrasing the sentence structure, adjusting modal verbs, replacing certain phrases, and changing the perspective from second person ('you') to first person ('I')\" where appropriate.\n\nBut I should check if there's a single instruction that covers all cases. Let's see:\n\nFor the first input, changing \"can you\" to \"would you be able to\" – that's a rephrasing of the modal verb. For input 2, converting \"see you\" into a statement of intent. For input 4, replacing \"do you want\" with \"shall I\". For input 3, replacing \"I got what you said\" with \"I understood you\". For input 5, changing the perspective from \"you\" to \"I\".\n\nIf the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal tone, possibly by making it sound less direct and more polite or indirect, then all these outputs would fit. For example, using \"could\" instead of \"can\", replacing \"I think\" with \"in my opinion\", etc.\n\nAnother possible instruction could be: \"Generate a response that expresses the same meaning but in a more formal or polite manner by adjusting the sentence structure and vocabulary.\" This seems to encompass all the given examples.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a question or a statement depending on the original, but that seems less likely as the outputs vary between question and statement.\n\nIn conclusion, after analyzing all input-output pairs, the instruction most likely was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version by adjusting sentence structures, replacing certain phrases, and sometimes changing the perspective from the second person to the first person.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was likely: **\"Rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version by adjusting sentence structure, replacing specific phrases, and modifying the perspective where appropriate.\"**\n\n### Key Transformations Observed:\n1. **Modal Verbs and Politeness**:  \n   - \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\" (replaced \"can\" with \"be able to\" for formality).  \n   - \"Do you want...\" → \"Shall I...\" (replaced \"do you want\" with a formal request).  \n\n2. **Perspective Shift**:  \n   - \"See you...\" → \"I look forward to...\" (shifted from second-person address to \"I\").  \n   - \"Do you want me to...\" → \"Shall I...\" (directed to \"I\").  \n\n3. **Idiomatic to Direct**:  \n   - \"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\" (paraphrased an idiom into its literal meaning).  \n\n4. **Rephrasing Phrases**:  \n   - \"I think that...\" → \"It is my opinion that...\" (adjusted \"I think\" to indirect speech).  \n\nThese transformations collectively align with the goal of converting casual or direct language into more polite, formal, or structured expressions.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

Hmm. Each input seems to have a corresponding output with a certain transformation. Let me go through each pair one by one to see if I can spot a pattern or rule.\n\nStarting with the first pair:\nInput: \"I got what you said.\"\nOutput: \"I understood you.\"\n\nWait, so the output is replacing \"got\" with \"understood\". But why? \"Got\" here might be used colloquially to mean 'understand', right? So maybe the instruction is to replace informal expressions with more standard phrasing. But then looking at the second example:\n\nInput: \"Can you do all these tasks?\"\nOutput: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n\nHmm. Here, the original question is transformed into a more formal version. The structure changes from a direct yes/no question to a tag question using \"be able to\". That seems like changing the sentence structure. Wait, but why would the instruction involve both substituting phrases and restructuring sentences? Or maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a different kind of sentence type, like changing questions to statements or vice versa. Let's check the third example:\n\nInput: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\nHere, the output changes \"I\" to \"whom\". So the instruction might involve turning a pronoun into its object form. Because in the first example, it's replacing \"got\" with \"understood\", which is more formal. Second example changes the sentence structure. Third example replaces \"I\" with \"whom\". Fourth input:\n\nInput: \"I think that this is interesting.\"\nOutput: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n\nSo here, the entire clause is rephrased by starting with \"It is my opinion that...\". That's a common restructuring technique, like using the \"it is my opinion that...\" construction instead of starting with \"I think...\". Fifth input:\n\nInput: \"I considered many approaches.\"\nOutput: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n\nHere, the subject and verb are changed from first person singular (\"I considered\") to third person plural (\"Various approaches were considered\"). Wait, but that's not exactly a direct change. Maybe they changed \"many approaches\" to \"various approaches\", but also swapped the subject and verb? Like, the input is \"I did X\" and output is \"X were done\". Let me check the first input again: \"I got what you said.\" Output \"I understood you.\" So that's replacing \"got\" with \"understood\". Maybe the instruction is to replace informal words with more formal synonyms. But then the second example is changing the structure of the sentence, not just substituting words. Similarly, third example is replacing a pronoun with its object form. Fourth example is rephrasing a clause into a different structure. Fifth example is changing the subject from first person to plural and adjusting the verb accordingly.\n\nSo perhaps the original instruction had multiple aspects. Let me think about possible instructions that could cover all these transformations.\n\nLet's list each transformation:\n\n1. Replace informal \"got\" (meaning understand) with \"understood\".\n2. Restructure the question \"Can you...\" into a more formal \"Would you be able to...\"\n3. Replace \"I\" in the subject with \"whom\" in the object position.\n4. Rephrase \"I think that...\" into \"It is my opinion that...\"\n5. Change \"I considered\" to \"Various approaches were considered\".\n\nHmm. These transformations seem to involve different grammar rules and structures. Let me see if there's a common thread.\n\nLooking at the first example, replacing \"got\" with \"understood\" is a substitution of a verb form. The second example is restructuring the sentence from a direct question to a tag question. The third is changing a pronoun to its object form. The fourth is changing the subject from \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\". The fifth is changing the subject from first person to a generic \"approaches\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert each input into a reported speech structure. Let's check:\n\nReported speech typically uses \"said\", \"explained\", etc., followed by that clause. But the first input is not reported speech; it's a statement. The outputs don't fit. For example, \"I understood you\" isn't reported speech of the original statement. Unless \"said\" is implied. But that doesn't align with the outputs.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a different voice or perspective. Let's see:\n\n1. First input: \"I got what you said.\" If we consider this as indirect speech, the output \"I understood you\" is a paraphrase. But that doesn't seem like a strict transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert active to passive voice? Let's check the fifth example: Input \"I considered many approaches\" → Output \"Various approaches were considered.\" Here, the subject is changed from \"I\" to \"approaches\", and the verb is passive. So that's a passive voice conversion. But the other examples don't fit passive. The second example's structure becomes a tag question, not passive. The third example is changing \"I\" to \"whom\". The fourth example is rephrasing \"I think\" into \"my opinion\". The first example is a synonym replacement. So maybe the instruction isn't consistent across all examples, but each example follows a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to rephrase each input in a way that makes them more formal or polite. Let's see:\n\nFirst example: colloquial \"got\" → formal \"understood\".\nSecond: turning a direct question into a more polite form.\nThird: changing \"I\" to \"whom\" to make it more formal (object pronoun).\nFourth: rephrasing to start with \"It is my opinion\".\nFifth: changing \"I considered\" to \"Various approaches were considered\" which is more neutral.\n\nBut why the fifth example specifically changes the subject to \"various approaches\"? That seems like a different transformation. Alternatively, maybe it's about making the subject more abstract, like changing \"I\" to \"we\" or \"people\". But in the fifth example, it's \"various approaches\" instead of \"I\".\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might be to rephrase each sentence to use a different grammatical structure, such as changing from active to passive, or from declarative to interrogative, etc. Let's look again:\n\n1. Declarative → same?\nWait, first input is declarative, output is declarative. Second input is a question, output is a tag question. Third is declarative, output is declarative. Fourth is declarative, output is a reported statement. Fifth is declarative, output is passive.\n\nSo inconsistent. Maybe the instruction was to perform a specific type of transformation for each input, depending on the structure. For example:\n\n- When the input is a question, rephrase it as a tag question.\n- When the input is a statement, replace certain words.\n- When the input is a pronoun, change its form.\n- When the input contains \"I think\", rephrase it with \"It is my opinion\".\n- When the input is in first person, change to third person plural and make passive.\n\nBut that's very specific. However, the fifth example's output isn't exactly passive but a generalization. Let's look again:\n\n\"I considered many approaches.\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n\nSo instead of \"I\" (singular), it's \"various approaches\" (plural). So maybe the instruction is to rephrase in the passive voice, changing the subject to a more general noun phrase. But why \"various approaches\"? It could be that the original was about a specific approach, but the output generalizes it. Alternatively, it's just replacing \"I considered\" with \"approaches were considered\" without \"various\".\n\nBut the fifth output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" The word \"various\" wasn't in the input. So maybe that's part of the instruction: adding adjectives like \"various\" to make the subject more general. But that doesn't fit the first four examples. Alternatively, the fifth example adds \"various\" to make it more generic. So perhaps the instruction involves making generalizations when appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction was to rephrase each sentence into a slightly different form, possibly involving changing the subject, verb, and adding adjectives or phrases as needed. But this would require a very specific set of rules that vary per example, which is unlikely.\n\nWait, another thought: looking at the outputs, maybe each output is a translation into a different language and back, but that seems unlikely given the examples. Alternatively, the outputs are results of applying different transformations based on the input's structure.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to rephrase each input into a different type of sentence. Let's see:\n\n1. Input: Declarative → Output: Declarative (same)\n2. Input: Question → Output: Tag question (different structure)\n3. Input: Declarative → Output: Declarative with pronoun change\n4. Input: Declarative → Output: Reported statement\n5. Input: Declarative → Output: Passive voice\n\nBut how does that fit? The fifth example's passive might be a different transformation. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to perform a specific type of transformation based on the input's original structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each sentence in a way that makes it more formal. Let's see:\n\nFirst example: \"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\" That's a more formal way of expressing understanding. Second example: Changing the question into a more polite form. Third example: Replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" to formalize. Fourth example: Using \"it is my opinion\" to make it sound more formal. Fifth example: Changing \"I considered\" to \"various approaches were considered,\" which might be a more formal or general way of stating the action.\n\nIf that's the case, then the instruction could be: \"Make each output more formal by replacing informal expressions, restructuring sentences, using more formal phrasing, and generalizing nouns when necessary.\"\n\nBut let's verify this hypothesis against all examples:\n\n1. Input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" Formal replacement works here.\n2. Input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" This uses \"would be able to\" which is more formal than the simple \"can\". So fits the idea of making it more formal.\n3. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" adds formality by using the objective case.\n4. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" This transforms the first-person assertion into a more formal \"opinion\" phrasing.\n5. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" Here, \"considered\" becomes \"were considered\" (passive), and \"many approaches\" is replaced with \"various approaches\". This could be seen as a combination of making it more passive and generalizing the subject, which adds formality and avoids specificity.\n\nSo this seems to fit. The instruction likely was to rephrase each input into a more formal version, possibly by using synonyms, restructuring sentences, using formal phrasing, and generalizing nouns where applicable.\n\nTherefore, the instruction probably stated something like: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal version by replacing informal expressions with more formal alternatives, restructuring sentences where appropriate, and generalizing nouns when necessary.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been more specific, like \"Convert each input into a tag question,\" but that doesn't explain the other examples. Since each example applies different transformations, the most plausible instruction is to make the outputs more formal by applying various linguistic modifications.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided required each input to be rephrased into a more formal version through the following transformations:\n\n1. **Synonym Replacement**: Replace informal terms (e.g., \"got\") with their formal equivalents (\"understood\").\n2. **Structural Restructuring**: Convert direct questions into polite phrasing (e.g., \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\").\n3. **Pronoun Modification**: Use objective pronouns (e.g., \"whom\") to enhance formality in place of subjective forms.\n4. **Clausal Restructuring**: Rephrase subjective statements (\"I think that...\") into impersonal constructions (\"It is my opinion that...\").\n5. **Passivization and Generalization**: Transform first-person actions into passive voice or generalized nouns (e.g., \"I considered\" → \"Various approaches were considered\").\n\n**Final Instruction**:  \n\"Reformulate each input into a more formal version by replacing informal expressions, restructuring sentences, using objective pronouns, converting subjective statements to impersonal tones, and generalizing nouns where applicable.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs.\nHere are the input-output pairs:\n\nInput: Can you do all these tasks?\nOutput: Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\n\nInput: I think that this is interesting.\nOutput: It is my opinion that this is interesting.\n\nInput: The whole story was made up.\nOutput: The entire story was fabricated.\n\nInput: See you tonight.\nOutput: I look forward to meeting you tonight.\n\nInput: Do you want me to go with you?\nOutput: Shall I accompany you?\n\nThe instruction was<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<|begin_of_thought|>Okay, let's try to figure out what the original instruction might have been based on the given input-output pairs. Hmm, each input has a corresponding output that seems to be a slightly rephrased version. Let me look at them one by one.\n\nFirst pair: Input is \"Can you do all these tasks?\" and Output is \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" So the output isn't just a paraphrase but also changes the verb structure. Instead of using \"do\" followed by \"these tasks,\" it uses \"be able to accomplish.\" So maybe the instruction requires restructuring the sentence into a more formal or polite tone? Or perhaps changing the tense or modal verbs?\n\nSecond input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" Output is \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" Here, the original statement is changed from first person (\"I think\") to a more formal or passive voice (\"It is my opinion\"). That suggests that the instruction might be about rephrasing in a more polite or formal manner, replacing \"I think\" with \"it is my opinion.\"\n\nThird input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Output is \"The entire story was fabricated.\" This is a direct translation of \"made up\" to \"fabricated,\" which might imply that the instruction involved synonyms or converting informal terms to formal ones. But wait, \"made up\" can mean composed or invented, so maybe the instruction was to replace colloquial expressions with more technical terms.\n\nFourth input: \"See you tonight.\" Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This is a complete rephrasing from a casual greeting to a more formal expression of anticipation. The instruction here could be about transforming informal expressions into polite or professional phrasing.\n\nFifth input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\" Again, changing the structure from a question seeking permission or agreement to a more formal offer phrased as a suggestion. The modal verb \"want\" becomes \"shall,\" and the object \"go with you\" becomes \"accompany you.\"\n\nPutting all these together, each output seems to be taking a more formal or polite approach to the original input. Let's check the verbs again. For example, \"do\" (in the first input) becomes \"accomplish,\" which is a bit more positive and less direct. \"Think\" becomes \"opinion.\" \"Made up\" becomes \"fabricated.\" \"See you\" becomes \"look forward to meeting you.\" \"Want me to go\" becomes \"shall I accompany you.\" \n\nSo maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more polite or formal register. But looking deeper, some entries might involve more than just politeness. The third example changes \"was made up\" to \"was fabricated,\" which is a synonym substitution. The fourth example completely changes the structure and adds more words. The fifth uses \"shall\" which is somewhat formal.\n\nWait, but in the second example, \"I think...\" becomes \"It is my opinion...\" which is a different structure. So perhaps the instruction is about rewriting the input in a more formal style, replacing first-person statements with more objective or formal expressions. Additionally, in some cases, there's a change in the verb's meaning (like \"do\" to \"accomplish\"), which might hint at restructuring sentences beyond just formality.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the verbs used in outputs versus inputs. Let's list them:\n\nOriginal inputs:\n1. can → would be able to accomplish\n2. think → is my opinion\n3. made up → fabricated\n4. see you → look forward to meeting you\n5. want me to go → shall I accompany you\n\nOutputs:\n1. would be able to accomplish\n2. is my opinion\n3. fabricated\n4. look forward to meeting you\n5. shall I accompany you\n\nSo, the verbs in the outputs are mostly modal verbs (would, is, shall) or present tense linking verbs (was, is). The original inputs used more active verbs like \"can,\" \"think,\" \"make,\" \"see,\" \"want.\" \n\nLooking at each transformation:\n\n1. Change \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\". Here, \"can\" (ability) is replaced with a more hesitant or conditional phrase, but actually, \"can\" is about capability, while \"be able to\" is similar. Wait, maybe not. \"Can you do X?\" is a yes/no question asking if someone has the ability. \"Would you be able to do X?\" is more polite but doesn't necessarily change the meaning. However, the output here uses \"accomplish\" instead of \"do X,\" which adds a bit more formality.\n\n2. \"I think...\" becomes \"It is my opinion...\" So the first-person statement is converted into a third-person, passive-sounding statement. Also, \"think\" becomes \"opinion,\" which is a noun phrase.\n\n3. \"was made up\" → \"was fabricated\". Direct synonym substitution.\n\n4. \"See you...\" → \"I look forward to meeting you...\" Complete restructuring from a casual greeting to a more formal, anticipatory statement.\n\n5. \"Do you want me to...\" → \"Shall I...\" Again, changing the structure and using \"shall\" for a formal suggestion.\n\nHmm. So the instruction might require three things: 1) Rephrasing in a more formal or polite tone; 2) Synonym substitution for certain words (like \"made up\" to \"fabricated\"); 3) Restructuring entire sentences when necessary (like turning \"see you\" into a longer phrase).\n\nBut what's common among all these transformations? Let's think about the overall goal. Each output is a slightly more formal version of the input, often replacing contractions, changing personal pronouns, replacing informal verbs with more formal ones, or using different structures like \"is my opinion\" instead of \"I think.\" Some entries also involve expanding short phrases into longer, more descriptive ones (e.g., \"look forward to meeting you\" vs. \"see you\").\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a question, but looking at the outputs, none of them are questions except maybe the fifth input's output. Wait, fifth input's output is a question starting with \"Shall I...\" but the input was a question (\"Do you want...\"). So that's not exactly converting to a question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more polite or formal request or statement. Let's consider possible instructions:\n\n- \"Polite and Formal Rephrasing\": The friend was supposed to take each input and rephrase it into a more polite and formal version. This would explain the changes in \"can\" to \"able to,\" \"think\" to \"opinion,\" \"made up\" to \"fabricated,\" etc.\n\nAnother thought: the outputs sometimes use \"it is my opinion\" which is a common way to express someone else's view formally. Similarly, \"I look forward to\" is a formal expression of anticipation. So maybe the instruction required converting the speaker's perspective into a more detached or formal perspective, using such constructions.\n\nAdditionally, in some cases, the output seems to change the subject. For example, input 2 starts with \"I think,\" which is first person, but output is \"It is my opinion,\" third person. Similarly, input 3 uses \"the whole story was made up\" (passive voice?), output is \"the entire story was fabricated\" (also passive, but different verb).\n\nSo the instruction might involve multiple steps: possibly rephrasing in a more formal tone, changing personal pronouns to third person, using passive voice for certain verbs (like \"made up\" to \"fabricated\"), and changing verb tenses or modals where applicable.\n\nBut to formulate the instruction that would lead to these outputs, let's think: what task could someone be asked to perform where each input is transformed into the given outputs? The most likely instruction is something like \"Rewrite each of the following statements into a more formal and polite version of the original, maintaining the original meaning but altering the tone and structure accordingly.\"\n\nBut perhaps even more specific. Let's look for patterns in the transformations:\n\nFor the first input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n\nThe main changes here are \"can\" → \"be able to accomplish\" (though \"can\" and \"be able to\" are both about ability). The output is slightly more formal and uses a different construction. Maybe the instruction was to use a modal verb (like \"would\" instead of \"can\") and rephrase \"do\" as \"accomplish,\" which is more formal.\n\nSecond input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n\nThis replaces \"I think\" with \"my opinion,\" which is more formal and less assertive. The output is a statement of someone else's view rather than the speaker's own opinion. So the instruction might have been to restate the input as an objective observation or to remove the first-person perspective.\n\nThird input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n\nHere, \"made up\" is replaced with \"fabricated,\" which is a synonym. The instruction could have required replacing informal terms with more formal ones. \"Made up\" can mean composed, but \"fabricated\" is a stronger term implying creation or invention. So maybe the task was to replace colloquial expressions with more precise vocabulary.\n\nFourth input: \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n\nThis is a major structural change. The original is a short, informal greeting, and the output is a longer, formal statement expressing anticipation. The instruction might have required transforming casual expressions into more polite or professional greetings.\n\nFifth input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n\nThis changes the structure from a question asking for permission or agreement to a formal offer. \"Do you want me...\" becomes \"Shall I...\" with \"accompany\" replacing \"go with you.\" The instruction could have been to rephrase requests into offers or suggestions using \"shall\" and changing the verb to a more formal synonym.\n\nNow, considering all these possibilities, what's the common thread? The instruction likely involves rephrasing each input into a more formal and polite version. But how to phrase that instruction concisely?\n\nPossible instruction examples:\n\n1. \"Rearrange each input into a more formal and polite tone, maintaining the original meaning.\"\n2. \"Rewrite each sentence to sound more professional and polite without altering its core message.\"\n3. \"Convert each statement into a more polite and formal register, adjusting verb forms and structures as needed.\"\n4. \"Express each input in a more courteous and formal manner, using appropriate language conventions.\"\n\nAlternatively, looking for a specific pattern in the outputs, perhaps the instruction required changing the sentence structure in certain ways. For instance, turning questions into statements, removing contractions, replacing \"I\" with \"one\" or third person, using different verbs (e.g., \"do\" → \"accomplish\"), or changing modal verbs (e.g., \"want\" → \"shall\").\n\nAnother angle: some outputs use \"is my opinion\" which could indicate that the original input was a subjective statement, and the task was to rephrase it as an objective statement. But the first input is \"Can you...\" which is not obviously subjective.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace the phrase \"this is interesting\" with \"it is my opinion that this is interesting,\" which is a way to make the statement more about others' perspectives rather than the speaker's. But that only applies to the second input.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to transform each input into a question, but the outputs don't follow that. Let's see: first output is a statement, second is a statement, third is a statement, fourth is a statement, fifth is a question. Wait, the fifth output is a question. The input was a question: \"Do you want...\" and output is a question: \"Shall I...\" So perhaps for certain types of inputs, the output is a question, but not for others.\n\nWait, but in the first input, the output is a statement. So that can't be the case. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to make each response a yes/no question, but looking at the outputs, some are statements, some are questions. For example, third input's output is a statement, fifth is a question.\n\nHmm. So that approach might not work. Another idea: the outputs sometimes use \"shall,\" which is a modal often used for making offers or suggestions. The fifth input's output uses \"Shall I...\", which is a typical structure for making a request in a formal tone. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase requests into offers using \"shall I...\" and changing the verb.\n\nSimilarly, \"look forward to\" is a common expression for anticipation, which comes from the fourth input's output. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase greetings or future plans into expressions of looking forward.\n\nPutting all this together, the instruction might have been a combination of tasks: rephrase each input into a formal tone, adjust sentence structure where necessary, replace certain verbs or phrases with more formal equivalents, and in some cases, turn statements into questions or offers.\n\nTo sum up, the most plausible instruction is: \"Your task is to rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version, adjusting the structure and word choice as needed to enhance the courteousness and formality of the response.\" This covers the various transformations observed in the examples: changing personal pronouns, using modal verbs, replacing colloquial terms, restructuring sentences, and using formal expressions like \"shall\" and \"look forward to.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version**, adjusting the structure, word choice, and tone accordingly. Specifically:\n\n1. **Formalize Personal Pronouns**: Replace \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion\" (second input).\n2. **Use Modals for Politeness**: Convert \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\" (first input).\n3. **Replace Colloquial Phrases**: Change \"made up\" to \"fabricated\" (third input).\n4. **Restructure Greetings**: Transform \"See you...\" into \"I look forward to...\" (fourth input).\n5. **Offer Suggestion Formally**: Turn \"Do you want...\" into \"Shall I...\" (fifth input).\n\nThe overarching goal was to maintain the original meaning while enhancing formality and politeness through strategic linguistic adjustments.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

So, the user provided five input-output examples where their friend transformed each input into a specific output. My job is to reverse-engineer the rule or process the friend used to generate those outputs from the inputs.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to get a clearer view:\n\n1. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n2. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n3. Input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n4. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n5. Input: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\"\n\nHmm, looking at these, maybe there's a pattern in how each output sentence is constructed. Let's analyze each pair step by step.\n\nStarting with the first example. The input is a question starting with \"Do you...\" and the output is a question starting with \"Shall I...\". Both are about making a suggestion or offering help. The original is asking if the speaker should accompany someone, and the output is a question using \"Shall I\" to express willingness to do so. So perhaps the friend is replacing \"Do you want me to...\" with \"Shall I accompany you?\" by changing the verb structure and adjusting the pronoun.\n\nSecond input: The original is a statement about a story being made up (whole vs. entire), and the output changes \"whole\" to \"entire\" but keeps the same structure. So maybe when the original uses an adjective that has a more formal synonym, the friend substitutes it.\n\nThird input: The original is a question using \"Can you...\", and the output becomes \"Would you be able to...\" which adds \"able to\" after \"be\". So here, the structure changes from \"Can you X?\" to \"Would you be able to accomplish X?\" So adding \"able to\" might be part of the transformation.\n\nFourth input: The original is \"I considered many approaches,\" and the output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" Here, \"considered\" becomes passive voice, and \"many\" becomes \"various\". So perhaps converting the subject's action into passive voice and replacing \"many\" with \"various\".\n\nFifth input: \"I got what you said.\" becomes \"I understood you.\" So changing the verb phrase from \"got what [someone] said\" to \"understood [someone]\", directly stating comprehension instead of explaining what was received.\n\nNow, let's see if these transformations fit under a common theme. Maybe the friend is rephrasing the original sentence in a more formal or indirect way? For example, changing questions into statements, adjusting adjectives, changing pronouns, converting active to passive voice, etc.\n\nLooking at the first pair again: \"Do you want me to...\" vs. \"Shall I accompany you?\" The friend is taking the original conditional question (\"Do you want me to...\") and turning it into an offer using \"Shall I...\". This is like changing a request for permission into a proactive offer. So perhaps the instruction is to turn the input into an offer or proposal by rephrasing the question into a statement of willingness.\n\nBut wait, let's check other pairs. The second pair: \"was made up\" to \"was fabricated\". That's a change in verb phrasing, from past tense \"made\" to \"fabricated\", which is more formal. So maybe the instruction involves replacing informal verbs with their more formal counterparts.\n\nThird pair: \"Can you do...\" becomes \"Would you be able to accomplish...\" Adding \"able to\" might be part of making it more formal or indirect. So changing direct ability queries into more polite requests with \"would be able\".\n\nFourth pair: \"I considered many approaches\" to \"Various approaches were considered.\" Here, \"considered\" becomes passive voice, and \"many\" becomes \"various\". So maybe the instruction includes converting active voice to passive, and replacing \"many\" with \"various\" to make it more formal.\n\nFifth pair: \"got what you said\" to \"understood you\". Changing the way comprehension is expressed from passive reception (\"got what\") to active understanding (\"understood\"). So maybe the instruction is to rephrase understanding as a direct statement.\n\nBut how to unify these observations into a single instruction? Let's think about possible patterns.\n\nAnother approach: look for parts of speech changes or sentence structure modifications. For instance:\n\n- Changing questions to statements or vice versa.\n- Converting certain adjectives (e.g., whole → entire).\n- Adjusting verb tenses or forms (e.g., made → fabricated).\n- Changing modal verbs (can → would be able to).\n- Passive voice conversion (considered many → various were considered).\n- Replacing reported speech structures (got what you said → understood you).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the friend is translating the input into a more polite or formal version, maintaining the same meaning but altering the style.\n\nWait, looking at the third input-output pair: \"Can you do...\" becomes \"Would you be able to accomplish...\". The key here is adding \"able to\" after \"be\", which is a common way to make a more formal or indirect request. Similarly, the fifth example replaces \"got what you said\" with \"understood you\", which is a more straightforward expression of understanding.\n\nSo maybe the general instruction is to convert the input into a more formal or polite form, possibly by:\n\n1. Rephrasing questions into offers or proposals (e.g., changing \"Do you want...\" to \"Shall I...\").\n2. Using more formal synonyms for certain words (e.g., \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up\").\n3. Adding modifiers like \"able to\" to make requests more indirect.\n4. Converting active voice to passive voice.\n5. Replacing \"got what you said\" with \"understood you\".\n\nBut how to connect all these into a single instruction. Perhaps the instruction is to transform the input by rephrasing it into a more polite or formal equivalent, often by using synonyms, changing sentence structure, or adjusting modality.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the instruction as a set of transformations: For example, replace \"do you want\" with \"shall I\", replace \"whole\" with \"entire\", add \"able to\", convert active to passive, replace \"got what\" with \"understood\".\n\nBut maybe the friend's instruction was to \"convert the input into a more formal version by replacing certain words and adjusting sentence structure accordingly.\"\n\nAnother angle: Let's check the verbs. In the first example, \"want me to go\" vs. \"accompany you\". So the verb phrase \"want me to go\" becomes \"accompany you\". But how? Maybe replacing \"want someone to do X\" with \"accompany you\" by converting the request into an offer.\n\nIn the fourth example, \"considered many approaches\" becomes \"various approaches were considered\". So \"considered\" is in passive voice, and \"many\" becomes \"various\".\n\nThe second example, \"was made up\" becomes \"was fabricated\". So \"made up\" is replaced with \"fabricated\".\n\nThe third example, \"Can you do...\" becomes \"Would you be able to accomplish...\". So adding \"able to\".\n\nThe fifth example, \"got what you said\" becomes \"understood you\". So changing the verb phrase from passive to active.\n\nSo possible steps:\n\n1. If the input contains \"do you want me to\", replace with \"shall I accompany you\".\n2. Replace \"whole\" with \"entire\".\n3. Add \"able to\" after \"would be\".\n4. Convert active voice to passive voice.\n5. Replace \"got what you said\" with \"understood you\".\n\nBut this seems like a list of possible replacements rather than a single instruction.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be: \"For each input, rephrase it into a more formal version by adjusting verb tenses, replacing certain words, and modifying the sentence structure as needed.\"\n\nBut how to verify this. Let's test this hypothesis against the examples.\n\nTake the first input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Rephrased formally would be something like \"Shall I accompany you?\" which matches the output. The original is a question expressing desire, and the output is a polite offer.\n\nSecond input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Formal replacement could be \"The entire story was fabricated,\" which matches.\n\nThird input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" becomes \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" Adding \"able to\" makes it more formal and indirect.\n\nFourth input: Active voice \"I considered many approaches\" becomes passive \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n\nFifth input: \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you,\" changing passive to active and replacing \"got\" with \"understood.\"\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal version by making appropriate changes to verb phrases, pronouns, adjectives, and sentence structure, such as converting questions into offers, adjusting adjectives, adding modal auxiliaries, converting active to passive voice, and replacing less formal expressions with more direct ones.\n\nBut the problem is that the user might have given a single instruction that encompasses all these steps. However, given the examples, the friend might have followed a series of rules for each input. But the instruction given was a single one, not a list.\n\nWait, the user says: \"the instruction was...\" So the friend was following a specific set of instructions, likely a process or set of steps, which resulted in the outputs.\n\nGiven the variety of changes across the inputs, it's possible that the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or indirect version, adjusting sentence structure, replacing certain words, and ensuring politeness. However, without more context, we need to deduce the most general instruction that fits all these cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to translate the input into its more formal equivalent, often by using synonyms, changing question tags to offers, adjusting modality, etc. For example, replacing \"want\" with \"accompany,\" changing \"whole\" to \"entire,\" converting \"considered many\" to \"various were considered,\" and so on.\n\nAnother thought: The outputs often maintain the same number of words or structure. For instance, \"Do you want me to...\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" Same number of words, but structure changed. Similarly, \"The whole story was made up.\" becomes \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Also same structure, just a synonym.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to replace certain words with their more formal equivalents and adjust the sentence structure when necessary.\n\nLooking at all the examples, here's a possible pattern:\n\n1. When the input is a question starting with \"Do you want...\", replace it with \"Shall I...\". This is changing the structure from a request for permission to an offer.\n2. For adjectives like \"whole\" use \"entire\".\n3. Convert \"can you do...\" into \"would you be able to accomplish...\".\n4. Change \"considered many approaches\" to \"various approaches were considered\".\n5. Replace \"got what you said\" with \"understood you\".\n\nBut the challenge is to find a single instruction that encompasses all these. Maybe the instruction is to \"translate the input into a more formal version by replacing certain words, adjusting sentence structure, and modifying pronouns and verb tenses as required.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be specific steps, like:\n\n- If the input contains \"do you want\", rewrite it as \"shall I\".\n- Replace \"whole\" with \"entire\".\n- Add \"able to\" after \"would be\" when restructuring questions.\n- Convert active voice to passive voice.\n- Replace \"got what\" with \"understood\".\n\nBut since the user expects a single answer summarizing the instruction, perhaps the best way is to state that the friend was instructed to rephrase each input into a more formal version by replacing certain words and adjusting sentence structure, such as converting questions into offers, using synonyms, adding modals, changing active to passive voice, and replacing informal expressions with more direct or polite alternatives.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal version by adjusting sentence structure, replacing 'do you want' with 'shall I', changing 'whole' to 'entire', adding 'able to' in questions, converting active to passive, and replacing 'got what' with 'understood'.\"\n\nBut given that the user's examples cover different types of transformations, it's possible that the instruction is a combination of these adjustments. However, the friend must have followed a specific set of rules, which could be outlined in the instruction.\n\nWait, another angle: All the outputs seem to follow a pattern where they are more polite or formal than the inputs. For example:\n\n- From \"Do you...\" to \"Shall I...\" (more polite offer).\n- \"Was made up\" to \"was fabricated\" (formal synonym).\n- \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\" (more indirect request).\n- \"Considered many\" to \"various were considered\" (passive voice + synonym).\n- \"Got what\" to \"understood\" (direct statement).\n\nSo the instruction might be to \"polish the sentence for formality and politeness by replacing certain words, adjusting sentence structure, and changing verb tenses or forms where necessary.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be more specific: \"For each input, rephrase into a more formal version by:\n\n1. Replacing 'do you want' with 'shall I'.\n2. Using 'entire' instead of 'whole'.\n3. Adding 'able to' after 'would be' in questions.\n4. Converting active voice to passive voice.\n5. Replacing 'got what you said' with 'understood you'.\"\n\nBut given that the user's inputs and outputs vary widely, it's possible that the instruction is a set of rules, but perhaps the friend followed a specific procedure outlined in the instruction. However, since the user is asking for the instruction itself, not the friend's thinking process, the task is to deduce what instruction could have generated these outputs.\n\nAnother approach: Let's list all the possible transformations and see if they can be categorized.\n\n- Question-to-statement conversion (Do you want → Shall I)\n- Synonym substitution (whole → entire)\n- Modality addition (can → would be able to)\n- Passive voice conversion (considered many → various were considered)\n- Direct vs. reported speech (got what → understood)\n\nBut these are different types of transformations. Perhaps the instruction was to perform multiple operations on each input, depending on its content. However, the instruction given would have to cover all possibilities. Since we don't know the exact instruction, but we need to reverse-engineer it based on the outputs, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal version by adjusting verb phrases, replacing certain adjectives, changing sentence structure, and making the language more indirect or polite.\n\nTherefore, synthesizing all these observations, the instruction was likely: \"For each input, rephrase it into a more formal version by replacing certain words, adjusting sentence structure, and ensuring politeness through changes like converting questions into offers, using synonyms, adding modal auxiliaries, converting active to passive voice, and replacing informal expressions with more direct alternatives.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be broken down into specific rules, but given the examples, the most comprehensive answer would describe the process the friend followed, which included various linguistic transformations aimed at making the output more formal and polite.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe friend's instruction involved rephrasing each input into a more formal and polite version by applying a series of systematic transformations. Below is the synthesized instruction:\n\n---\n\n**Instruction:**  \nFor each input, rephrase it into a more formal and indirect version using the following guidelines:  \n\n1. **Convert Questions into Offers:**  \n   Replace \"Do you want me to...\" with \"Shall I...\" to turn requests into proactive offers.  \n\n2. **Replace Informal Synonyms:**  \n   - Substitute \"whole\" with \"entire\".  \n   - Use \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up\".  \n\n3. **Polish Requests for Indirectness:**  \n   Replace \"Can you...\" with \"Would you be able to accomplish...\" by adding \"able to\" and adjusting modality.  \n\n4. **Adjust Sentence Structure:**  \n   - Convert active voice to passive voice (e.g., \"I considered many approaches\" → \"Various approaches were considered\").  \n   - Restructure to eliminate \"got what\" by using \"understood\".  \n\n5. **Ensure Formality:**  \n   Apply synonyms, modal auxiliaries, and indirect phrasing to enhance politeness and formality.  \n\n**Example Transformations:**  \n- Input: *\"Do you want me to go with you?\"* → Output: *\"Shall I accompany you?\"* (conversion to offer).  \n- Input: *\"The whole story was made up.\"* → Output: *\"The entire story was fabricated.\"* (synonym substitution).  \n- Input: *\"Can you do all these tasks?\"* → Output: *\"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"* (modal addition and phrasing).  \n- Input: *\"I considered many approaches.\"* → Output: *\"Various approaches were considered.\"* (passive voice conversion).  \n- Input: *\"I got what you said.\"* → Output: *\"I understood you.\"* (replacement of informal reporting with direct statement).  \n\n---\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, the friend systematically transformed each input into a more formal and polite variant, aligning with the observed outputs.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs where each input has been transformed into an output following a certain rule. My job is to deduce the underlying instruction based on these examples.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the pattern between each input and output. Let me go through them one by one.\n\n1. **Input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\"**  \n   **Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"**  \n   Hmm, the output seems to rephrase the question. Instead of using \"can\" directly, it uses \"would be able to accomplish\". Also, \"do\" is replaced with \"accomplish\". Not sure about the exact transformation yet.\n\n2. **Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\"**  \n   **Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"**  \n   Here, the first person (\"I think\") is converted to third person (\"It is my opinion\"), and the rest remains similar. So the instruction might involve changing the perspective or formality.\n\n3. **Input: \"See you tonight.\"**  \n   **Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"**  \n   The original is a casual greeting. The output is more formal, expressing anticipation rather than a simple \"see you\".\n\n4. **Input: \"This song is fire.\"**  \n   **Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"**  \n   The slang term \"fire\" is converted into a more standard positive adjective phrase. So replacing slang with formal equivalents?\n\n5. **Input: \"I considered many approaches.\"**  \n   **Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"**  \n   The subject \"I\" is removed, and \"considered\" becomes passive voice \"were considered\", while \"many\" is changed to \"various\". Also, \"approaches\" stays the same but maybe in plural.\n\nLooking for common themes:  \n\n- From 1st to 3rd person (examples 2,3,5).  \n- Formalizing the language (examples 2,3,4).  \n- Converting \"can\" to \"be able to accomplish\" (example 1).  \n- Changing informal expressions like slang (example 4).  \n- Passive voice conversion (example 5).  \n\nWait, example 1: Original is a question, output is also a question but phrased differently. Maybe converting the entire input into a reported speech? Like changing \"you can\" to \"you would be able to\". But why not just rephrase the entire sentence? Similarly, example 3: \"See you\" becomes a longer expression. Example 5: active vs passive. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version. Let's see:\n\n- \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\" – Polite form.\n- \"I think...\" → \"It is my opinion...\" – Formal.\n- \"See you...\" → \"I look forward...\" – Formal and polite.\n- \"This song is fire.\" → \"Incredibly good\" – Formal equivalent.\n- \"I considered...\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" – Passive voice and formal nouns.\n\nSo possible instruction: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal, polite, or professional version.\" Or maybe \"Convert each input into a more formal and polite expression.\" But let's check if there are other possibilities.\n\nAnother angle: The outputs are often longer, more verbose versions. So the instruction might be to expand or elaborate on the inputs. For example, expanding abbreviations or jargon (like \"fire\" to \"incredibly good\"). But example 3 is shortening (\"See you\" to \"look forward to meeting you\"), which seems counterintuitive unless part of a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to translate the input into another language and back, but that seems unlikely given the consistent transformations here. More likely, it's a textual transformation rule.\n\nLet's consider each example's structure:\n\n1. Question to question, changing \"can\" to \"be able to\".  \n2. First-person to third-person, formalizing.  \n3. Casual greeting to formal statement.  \n4. Slang to standard adjective.  \n5. Active to passive, removing \"I\", changing \"many\" to \"various\".\n\nHmm. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or neutral tone, possibly changing perspective, tense, or formality. Alternatively, convert each input into a more polite or professional version.\n\nAnother thought: The outputs are often using more words and more formal language. For instance, \"See you tonight\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you tonight,\" which is a more formal way of saying goodbye and expressing eagerness. Similarly, \"I think\" becomes \"It is my opinion,\" making it more formal and less direct. \"Can you...\" becomes \"Would you be able to,\" which is a more polite phrasing.\n\nLooking at example 5: \"I considered many approaches.\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" So changing first-person to passive, \"considered\" becomes \"were considered,\" and \"many\" to \"various.\" This suggests a transformation from active to passive voice and changing quantity terms.\n\nCombining all these observations, perhaps the instruction is to transform each input into a more formal or polite version by:\n\n- Changing the perspective (first to third person, or vice versa, depending on original)\n- Replacing contractions with full forms\n- Using more formal verbs or phrases (e.g., \"could you\" instead of \"can you\")\n- Converting slang to standard terminology\n- Changing pronouns (removing \"I\" in some cases, like example 5)\n- Using passive voice when appropriate\n\nBut let's check if the instruction would cover all these cases. For example, the first example is a question transformed into another question with different phrasing. The second is a first-person statement to third-person. The third is a greeting to an anticipation phrase. The fourth is slang to formal adjective. The fifth is active to passive.\n\nSo the instruction might be something like: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal and polite expression, adjusting grammar, perspective, and vocabulary as necessary.\"\n\nBut let's see if there's a single rule or set of rules that can explain all these transformations. Alternatively, maybe it's a combination of multiple rules:\n\n1. Convert first-person singular to third-person singular.  \n   Input: \"I think...\" → Output: \"It is my opinion...\"  \n2. Replace informal expressions with formal ones.  \n   \"See you\" → \"look forward to meeting you\" (formal anticipation)  \n   \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\" (formal praise)  \n3. Convert questions into more polite forms.  \n   \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\"  \n4. Change active voice to passive where applicable.  \n   \"I considered...\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\"  \n5. Remove first-person pronouns where possible.  \n   \"I looked forward\" → \"look forward\" is kept, but \"I considered\" becomes passive. Wait, in example 5, the output starts with \"Various approaches were considered,\" so the \"I\" is gone. So perhaps when the original uses \"I\", it gets omitted or changed in context.\n\nPutting this together, the instruction might be: \"Rework each input into a more formal, polite, and professional version by adjusting grammatical structure, perspective, and vocabulary. For example, convert first-person statements to third-person, replace contractions and informal expressions, rephrase questions into more polite inquiries, and use passive voice when appropriate.\"\n\nBut to confirm, let's see if applying such a rule would produce the outputs from the inputs.\n\nTake the first input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\"  \nFormal version would be \"Could you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" or \"Would you be able to complete all these tasks?\" But the output is \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" So replacing \"can\" with \"be able to accomplish\" instead of \"complete.\" Hmm. So maybe the rule is to replace \"can\" with \"be able to accomplish\" and adjust the verb. Alternatively, the rule could be to rephrase the entire question into a different phrasing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input by making it a request rather than a question. For example, \"Can you...\" becomes \"Would you be able to...\", which is a way to make a request. But in example 5, \"I considered...\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered,\" which is a change in voice and perspective.\n\nThis makes it challenging. Perhaps the key is that each output is a variation of the input, transformed according to certain rules. The instruction must be general enough to encompass all these transformations.\n\nAnother approach: Look for a common pattern across all outputs relative to their inputs. Let's compare each pair:\n\n1. Input: Question → Output: Similar question but rephrased.  \n2. Input: First-person opinion → Output: Third-person opinion.  \n3. Input: Greeting → Output: Formal anticipation.  \n4. Input: Slang praise → Output: Formal praise.  \n5. Input: Active past tense → Output: Passive past tense with changes in pronoun and noun quantity.\n\nNoticing that in example 5, \"I considered\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered.\" So \"I\" is removed, \"considered\" becomes \"were considered\" (passive), and \"many approaches\" becomes \"various approaches.\" So maybe the rule is to convert active voice to passive, remove the subject \"I,\" and replace \"many\" with \"various.\"\n\nSimilarly, example 3: \"See you\" (casual) becomes \"I look forward to meeting you\" (formal). So maybe the instruction includes converting greetings or farewells into expressions of looking forward or anticipation.\n\nIn example 2: \"I think\" becomes \"It is my opinion,\" which is a way to express the same idea but in a more formal way, using \"it is my opinion\" as a polite substitute for \"I think.\"\n\nFor the first example, \"Can you...\" becomes \"Would you be able to...\" which is a more polite and less direct way of asking for capability. So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more polite or formal version, possibly using different structures or vocabulary.\n\nCombining all these possibilities, the most comprehensive instruction that fits all examples would be: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal, polite, or professional version by adjusting grammar, perspective, and vocabulary as needed. For example, convert first-person statements to third-person, replace contractions, rephrase questions into more polite requests, transform informal expressions into standard terms, and use passive voice where appropriate.\"\n\nAlternatively, if we look for a specific instruction that could generate all outputs, perhaps the user instructed the friend to rephrase each input into its \"proper\" or formal version, considering various linguistic transformations. The exact phrasing of the instruction could be something like:\n\n\"Refine each input into a more formal or polite expression by adjusting grammar, vocabulary, and perspective. For example, convert questions into more polite phrasing, replace contractions, formalize opinions, elaborate on greetings, and alter slang expressions.\"\n\nAnother possible instruction could be: \"Express each input in a more formal and professional manner by modifying grammar, word choice, and tone as necessary.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might be to \"Polish each input by adjusting its grammatical structure, formality level, and vocabulary to make it clearer and more appropriate for a professional context.\"\n\nBut since the user provided examples where the outputs are variously more formal, polite, expanded, or changed in grammar (like passive voice), the instruction likely encompasses these aspects.\n\nAfter analyzing all the transformations, the most plausible instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or professional version by adjusting grammar, vocabulary, perspective, and tone as needed. This covers the conversion from informal to formal expressions, rephrasing questions into requests, changing perspectives, altering slang, and adjusting sentence structure (active to passive).\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction appears to be **to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or professional version** by adjusting grammar, vocabulary, perspective, and tone as necessary. This involves converting informal expressions into formal terms, rephrasing questions into more polite inquiries, altering perspectives (e.g., first-person to third-person), transforming slang or colloquialisms into standard terminology, and restructuring sentences (e.g., active to passive voice). \n\n### Final Answer:\nThe instruction was:  \n**\"Redesign each input into a more formal and professional version by refining grammar, vocabulary, perspective, and tone.\"**\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

Hmm. So the user provided five input-output pairs, each showing how the friend transformed the original sentence. I need to find a pattern or rule that would explain all these transformations.\n\nFirst, looking at the first pair: Input \"I got what you said.\" becomes \"I understood you.\" Wait, but the output doesn't exactly match. The original says \"got what you said,\" which is a bit colloquial, and the output is more formal \"understood you.\" Maybe the instruction is about rephrasing into more formal language? But let's check other examples to see if this holds.\n\nSecond example: Input \"See you tonight.\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" Oh, here the input is an informal way to say goodbye, and the output is a formal version expressing anticipation. So maybe the instruction is to convert casual expressions into formal, polite phrasing?\n\nThird input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" becomes \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" Again, changing the negative \"can't\" to \"find it hard to,\" and adjusting the structure from \"tell the difference\" to \"distinguish between.\"\n\nFourth input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" becomes \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" Here, changing a yes/no question (\"Can you...\") into a more polite form with \"Would you be able to...\" adding \"able to\" and changing \"do\" to \"accomplish,\" which is more formal.\n\nFifth input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" So here, converting the present tense \"Do you want me...\" to \"Shall I...\" which is a more old-fashioned or formal way to ask for permission.\n\nPutting these together, there seems to be a pattern of converting informal or conversational language into more formal, polite phrasing. Each output is phrased in a way that sounds more formal, polite, and perhaps elevated in tone.\n\nWait, but let's check another angle. Let me think if there's any other possible instruction. For example, maybe the instruction is to rephrase positive statements into questions? But in the first example, the output isn't a question. Alternatively, maybe it's about making the statements more direct or indirect. For instance, \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you,\" which is more direct. But the second example changes \"See you\" into a longer expression. So perhaps the key is that the instruction is to transform the input into a more formal, polite, and slightly elevated version of speech.\n\nAnother observation: All outputs use \"I\" as the subject, whereas some inputs might not. For example, \"I can't...\" becomes \"I find it hard...\" So maybe the instruction requires replacing \"I\" with \"I\" (no change) but changing the verb structure. Wait, but in the third example, the input is passive (\"can't tell the difference\") and the output is active (\"find it hard to distinguish\"). So that's a structural change as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence using more formal language, perhaps by replacing contractions, changing verb tenses, or using more sophisticated vocabulary. Let's see:\n\nOriginal inputs:\n1. I got what you said. → I understood you. (replaced \"got\" with \"understood\", \"what\" to \"you\" in a different construction)\n2. See you tonight. → I look forward to meeting you tonight. (changed \"see you\" to a formal expression)\n3. I can't tell the difference. → I find it hard to distinguish. (replaced \"can't tell\" with \"find it hard to distinguish\")\n4. Can you do... → Would you be able to accomplish... (replaced \"can\" with \"be able to\", added \"would\" and changed \"do\" to \"accomplish\")\n5. Do you want me to go... → Shall I accompany you? (replaced \"do\" with \"shall\", changed \"want me to\" to \"accompany you\")\n\nSo, the common elements across all transformations are:\n- Converting first-person present tense into more formal verbs (like \"understand\" instead of \"got\", \"look forward to\" instead of \"see\").\n- Changing questions from \"can you...\" or \"do you...\" to more formal requests like \"would you be able to...\" or \"shall I...\".\n- Using more formal expressions like \"find it hard to distinguish\" instead of \"can't tell the difference\".\n- Adding prepositions or phrases like \"look forward to\", \"accompany you\", etc., to make the sentences more complete and formal.\n\nAdditionally, some examples involve restructuring the sentence entirely. For instance, \"I can't tell the difference between these two\" becomes \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" Here, the entire structure is changed, perhaps to avoid the negative in the original.\n\nConsidering all these patterns, the most plausible instruction is: \"Convert the given input into a more formal, polite, and elevated version of the original sentence, while maintaining its meaning.\" Or more specifically, the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more formal and polite form, using more sophisticated vocabulary and structure.\n\nAnother possible angle: looking for synonyms or similar phrasing. For example, \"understood\" vs. \"understand,\" \"look forward to\" vs. \"anticipate,\" \"find it hard to distinguish\" vs. \"can't tell the difference.\" All these changes aim for formality and politeness.\n\nTesting this hypothesis against the examples:\n\n1. \"I got what you said.\" → Formal: \"I understood you.\" Correct.\n2. \"See you tonight.\" → Formal: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" Yes.\n3. \"I can't tell the difference...\" → Formal: \"I find it hard to distinguish...\" Correct.\n4. \"Can you do...\" → Formal: \"Would you be able to accomplish...\" Correct.\n5. \"Do you want me...\" → Formal: \"Shall I accompany you?\" Correct.\n\nYes, this seems to fit. Therefore, the instruction likely told the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version, possibly emphasizing different verb forms, more elevated vocabulary, and complete sentence structures where necessary.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to the friend was to **rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, and elevated version of the original sentence**, ensuring the transformation adhered to conventional social etiquette and grammatical correctness. This involved replacing colloquial expressions with their formal equivalents, restructuring sentences for clarity, and enhancing vocabulary to achieve a refined tone. \n\n### Key Transformations Identified:\n1. **Colloquial to Formal Language**:  \n   - Example 1: \"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\" (replaced \"got\" with \"understood\")  \n   - Example 2: \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" (rewrote casual farewell to formal expectation).\n\n2. **Question Politeness**:  \n   - Example 4: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" (replaced \"can\" with \"be able to\" and added \"would\" for politeness).\n\n3. **Structural Adjustments**:  \n   - Example 3: \"I can't tell the difference...\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish...\" (restructured negative to neutral phrasing).  \n   - Example 5: \"Do you want me to go...\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\" (rephrased question to a formal invitation).\n\nThese transformations collectively reflect the overarching goal of **elevating casual or direct speech into a more formal, polite register**, ensuring adherence to social conventions and grammatical nuances.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

Hmm, first, I need to look at each input and see how the output transformed it. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with the first pair:\nInput: \"Please call once you get there.\"\nOutput: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\nSo here, \"once you get there\" was changed to \"upon your arrival\". That suggests maybe the instruction is about replacing certain phrases with others. Maybe converting time-based expressions into event-based ones? Or perhaps shortening or rephrasing some parts.\n\nSecond example:\nInput: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\"\nOutput: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\nThis seems like changing a negative statement into a positive suggestion. The original is saying \"we don't think it's a good idea to do anything,\" which is a bit passive. The output uses \"it is suggested that no action should be taken,\" which sounds more formal and proactive.\n\nThird input:\n\"Do you want me to go with you?\"\nOutput: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\nHere, \"Do you want\" is turned into \"Shall I\". The original is a polite request, and the output is a question using \"Shall I\", which is a more formal way to offer help. So maybe the instruction is to convert requests into offers of assistance using \"Shall I\"?\n\nFourth input:\n\"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nOutput: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nIn this case, \"met\" was changed to \"whom met\", but wait, the output says \"whom I met yesterday\". Wait, the original says \"I met\", and the output has \"whom I met\". So maybe the instruction involves changing possessive pronouns? Let me check again. Original: \"The lawyer I met yesterday...\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday...\". So the change is from \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". So perhaps the instruction was to replace \"met\" with \"whom met\"? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no—the output is \"whom\" instead of \"I\". Because in the original input, it's \"I met\", and the output is \"whom I met\". Wait, no, actually, the original says \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So \"I met\" became \"whom I met\". So the instruction might be to replace \"met\" with \"whom met\", but that seems off. Wait, maybe the original instruction was to use the relative pronoun instead of the possessive? Let me think. The original uses \"I met\", and the output uses \"whom I met\". But \"whom\" is the object of the verb, so maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentence structure, using \"whom\" as the relative pronoun? For example, changing \"I met the lawyer\" to \"the lawyer whom I met\". That could be part of the instruction. So perhaps the task was to replace \"met\" with \"whom met\", but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's changing the subject's perspective? Wait, the original is \"I met the lawyer\", the output is \"the lawyer whom I met\". So the output is a relative clause where the lawyer is the one met by the speaker. So maybe the instruction was to convert the sentence into a relative clause using \"whom\", thereby making it a possessive-like reference? That would fit with the third example, where \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\"—both examples seem to involve rephrasing questions into offers, and changing certain phrasing.\n\nFifth input:\n\"This song is fire.\"\nOutput: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\nHere, \"fire\" was replaced with \"incredibly good\". So maybe the instruction was to translate slang or informal expressions into more formal or standard equivalents. Fire can mean impressive or excellent in slang, so replacing it with a synonym like \"incredibly good\".\n\nNow, putting all these together. Let's see possible patterns.\n\nFirst, the second example transforms a negative statement into a positive suggestion. The third example turns a request into an offer (\"Do you want... → Shall I...\"). The fourth example changes \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". The fifth replaces slang with more formal language. The first example changes \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival\"—maybe converting cause-effect or time references into event-based expressions. Alternatively, maybe it's rephrasing the sentence structure to sound more polite or formal.\n\nWait, the output of the first example is \"Please call upon your arrival.\" So \"once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival\". That could be part of making the sentence more formal or euphemistic. Similarly, \"do anything\" becomes \"take action\", which is more action-oriented. The output of the second example uses \"suggested\" and \"no action should be taken\", which is more formal.\n\nSo maybe the overall instruction was to rewrite the input sentences in a more formal or polite manner, possibly rephrasing certain common expressions. Let's check each transformation:\n\n1. \"Once you get there\" → \"Upon your arrival\": Both refer to the same event but phrased differently. Perhaps replacing casual time expressions with more formal ones.\n2. \"Don't think it's a good idea to do anything\" → \"No action should be taken\": Converting a negative prohibition into a positive suggestion of not acting.\n3. \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\": Changing the phrasing from a question about desire to a formal offer.\n4. \"Met yesterday\" → \"Whom I met yesterday\": Using a relative clause with \"whom\" instead of \"I met\".\n5. \"This song is fire\" → \"This song is incredibly good\": Replacing slang with a more standard adjective.\n\nSo combining all these transformations, the instruction might have been to rewrite each input sentence in a more formal or polite tone, possibly using different phrasing for certain structures. Let's hypothesize the original instruction: \"Convert each input into a more formal version by replacing informal expressions, restructuring sentences for politeness, and using more formal vocabulary.\"\n\nBut let's test if that aligns with the examples.\n\nFirst example: Input is a request to call when arriving. Output uses \"upon your arrival\" which is more formal. So yes, formalizing.\n\nSecond example: Turning a negative into a positive suggestion (suggestion vs. not thinking it's a good idea). Formalizing by using \"suggested\" and \"should be taken\".\n\nThird example: Changing \"Do you want\" to \"Shall I\" which is a more formal way to offer help.\n\nFourth example: Changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\", which uses a relative clause instead of the possessive pronoun, perhaps for formality or clarity.\n\nFifth example: Replacing slang \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\", which is more formal.\n\nSo the instruction likely involved taking each input and rewriting it in a more formal or polite style, possibly rephrasing certain common expressions. The key elements are:\n\n- Formalizing language (replacing contractions, using more formal verbs).\n- Restructuring sentences for politeness (e.g., changing requests into offers, suggestions).\n- Translating informal or slang expressions into standard vocabulary.\n\nNow, considering all these aspects, the instruction could be phrased as: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal and polite version by replacing informal expressions, restructuring sentences for politeness, and using more standard vocabulary.\" \n\nAlternatively, breaking down the components:\n\n- Handle time phrases: Replace casual terms with event-based ones.\n- Handle suggestions/prohibitions: Convert negatives into positives.\n- Handle offers vs. requests: Change \"Do you want...\" to \"Shall I...\" type phrasing.\n- Handle possessive pronouns in relative clauses: Use \"whom\" to refer back to the subject.\n- Replace slang with synonyms for standard adjectives.\n\nPutting all this together, the original instruction was probably something along the lines of: \"For each input, transform the text into a more formal and polite version by rephrasing time-related expressions, converting suggestions into recommendations, turning requests into offers of help, restructuring sentences to avoid contractions and possessives, and replacing informal terms with standard synonyms.\" \n\nAlternatively, maybe a more concise instruction like: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version by replacing casual phrases with their formal equivalents, restructuring sentences where appropriate, and avoiding slang.\"\n\nTesting this against the examples:\n\nFirst example fits: replacing \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\" (formal).\n\nSecond example: turning a negative into a positive recommendation (formal).\n\nThird example: changing \"Do you want\" to \"Shall I\" (more polite, formal).\n\nFourth example: replacing \"met\" with \"whom I met\" (using relative clause for formality).\n\nFifth example: replacing \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\" (standard adjective).\n\nThus, the instruction seems to fit this pattern. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version, involving various transformations as observed.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe original instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version** by applying the following transformations:\n\n1. **Formalize Time/Event Expressions**: Replace casual phrases like \"once you get there\" with more formal equivalents like \"upon your arrival\".\n2. **Convert Suggestions/Prohibitions**: Transform negative statements into positive recommendations (e.g., \"We don’t think it’s a good idea\" → \"It is suggested that no action should be taken\").\n3. **Offer Help Instead of Requests**: Rewrite queries like \"Do you want me to...\" into polite offers using \"Shall I...\" (e.g., \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\").\n4. **Use Relative Clauses for Clarity**: Replace possessive pronouns (e.g., \"I met\") with relative clauses using \"whom\" (e.g., \"The lawyer I met yesterday\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday\").\n5. **Replace Slang with Standard Adjectives**: Convert informal terms like \"fire\" into formal equivalents (e.g., \"This song is fire\" → \"This song is incredibly good\").\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe instruction was to rephrase each input into a **more formal and polite version**, restructuring sentences to use event-based phrases, avoid contractions, offer assistance instead of asking, use relative clauses for clarity, and replace slang with standard vocabulary.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs.\nHere are the input-output pairs:\n\nInput: This song is fire.\nOutput: This song is incredibly good.\n\nInput: Can you do all these tasks?\nOutput: Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\n\nInput: I got what you said.\nOutput: I understood you.\n\nInput: She looks like her sister.\nOutput: She resembles her sister.\n\nInput: Please call once you get there.\nOutput: Please call upon your arrival.\n\nThe instruction was<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<|begin_of_thought|>Okay, let's try to figure out the original instruction that the friend used to generate those output examples. Hmm, the user provided five input-output pairs, and I need to determine what transformation or rule each input underwent to become the output. Let me start by analyzing each pair carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\nSo, the original statement is a colloquial expression (\"fire\") which is being converted into a more formal or descriptive phrase. \"Incredibly good\" replaces \"fire\". Maybe the instruction was to translate informal slang into standard English expressions.\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\nHere, the question is rephrased. The verb tense changes from present (can) to past (would + be able). The structure \"do all these tasks\" becomes \"accomplish all these tasks\", which might be a more formal way of phrasing the same idea. Also, \"can you\" becomes \"would you be able to\", which adds politeness and formality.\n\nThird pair:\nInput: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\"\nBreaking this down, the original statement is concise but uses \"got\" as a colloquial way to say \"understood\". The output converts it to a more direct and slightly less conversational version by replacing \"got what you said\" with \"understood you\". So maybe the instruction was to convert informal expressions of comprehension into more direct statements.\n\nFourth pair:\nInput: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\nHere, \"looks like\" is replaced with \"resembles\". Both mean similar things, but \"resembles\" is a more formal or precise choice. It's a synonym substitution in context where formality is increased.\n\nFifth pair:\nInput: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\nAgain, the output seems more formal. \"Once you get there\" is transformed into \"upon your arrival\", which is a more elevated phrasing. The verb tense doesn't change here, but the overall structure becomes more formal, using \"your arrival\" instead of a simpler conditional clause.\n\nNow, putting all these observations together. Each output appears to be a more formal or polite version of the input, sometimes with synonym substitutions, sometimes rephrasing to maintain formality. Let's check if there's a common thread.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n1. Fire → incredibly good (metaphorical praise becoming descriptive)\n2. Can → would be able (polite phrasing)\n3. Got what you said → understood (direct comprehension)\n4. Looks like → resembles (synonym)\n5. Once you get there → upon your arrival (formal phrasing)\n\nPossible instruction: \"Politize and formalize the sentence by rephrasing, adding more formal language and/or synonyms when possible.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to replace informal or slang terms with more formal equivalents, adjust verb tenses for politeness, or use more precise vocabulary.\n\nWait, another angle: Could the instruction be about making the sentences more \"euphemistic\" or using more positive diction? For example, \"fire\" is a slang term implying something is great, so replacing it with \"incredibly good\" is more positive and formal.\n\nOr perhaps the instruction is to take a statement and turn it into a more formal query or command. Like, the second example takes a question and makes it more polite. But not all outputs are questions. Wait, except for the second input which was a question, the rest were statements.\n\nSo maybe the general instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly by making the tone more respectful, replacing informal terms with synonyms, altering sentence structure for formality, etc.\n\nBut let's see if there's a pattern across all inputs. For instance, in all cases, the output seems more formal than the input. Let's check the first input again: \"This song is fire.\" The output is \"This song is incredibly good.\" The original is a colloquial way of saying it's great; the output is a more measured, perhaps more professional description.\n\nSimilarly, the third input: \"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\" Here, the output uses a more direct verb instead of the colloquial \"got\".\n\nFourth input: \"Looks like\" vs \"resembles\" – both are correct, but \"resembles\" is more formal.\n\nFifth input: \"Once you get there\" → \"Upon your arrival.\" Formalizing the preposition phrase.\n\nSo the instruction seems to be about converting informal, conversational language into more formal, polite, or precise language. The key elements could be:\n\n- Replace informal slang or phrases with their formal equivalents (e.g., fire → incredibly good)\n- Use more polite phrasing (e.g., can → would be able to)\n- Convert informal verbs into more precise ones (e.g., got → understood)\n- Adjust sentence structure for formality (e.g., looks like → resembles)\n- Rephrase conditional clauses (once you get there → upon your arrival)\n\nPutting this together, the instruction likely instructs the friend to transform each input into a more formal, polite version by rephrasing where necessary, replacing informal expressions with their more formal counterparts, adjusting verb tenses or structures for politeness, and using synonyms for clearer or more elevated diction.\n\nAnother possible angle: Some of the outputs seem to add more descriptive language. For example, \"fire\" becomes \"incredibly good,\" which adds intensity. Similarly, \"resembles\" adds a specific connotation compared to \"looks like.\" But this might be part of making the statement more formal rather than descriptive.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to translate from informal to formal register, maintaining the meaning but altering the style. The examples show that even though some outputs are more positive, others just maintain neutrality but in a more formal tone.\n\nLet me check if the instruction could be phrased as \"Convert each input into a more formal and polite statement by rephrasing, replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents, adjusting verb tenses, and using more precise vocabulary.\"\n\nYes, that seems plausible. Looking at the outputs:\n\nFirst input: informal slang → formal description.\nSecond input: informal question → formal polite phrasing.\nThird input: informal agreement → formal direct statement.\nFourth input: informal description → synonym.\nFifth input: informal conditional → formal phrasing.\n\nEach case fits a more formal, polite transformation. Therefore, the instruction was probably along those lines.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided was likely:  \n**\"Convert each input into a more formal and polite statement by rephrasing, replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents, adjusting verb tenses, and using more precise vocabulary.\"**\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Formalization**: Outputs reduce colloquialisms (e.g., \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\") and informal verb phrases (e.g., \"got what you said\" → \"understood\").\n2. **Politeness**: Phrases like \"can you\" become \"would you be able to\" for greater formality.\n3. **Synonym Substitution**: \"Looks like\" → \"resembles\" enhances precision.\n4. **Structural Adjustments**: \"Once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\" elevates phrasing.\n\nThis instruction guides transforming inputs into more formal, respectful, and precise language.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",
